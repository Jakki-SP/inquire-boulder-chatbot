Animal Noise (Barking Dogs),Animals,Police ,Animal Noise (Barking Dogs),"Please contact Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint.

To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code."
Animal Noise (Barking Dogs),Animals,Police ,How can I deal with a barking dog?,"If a dog is causing a nuisance and disturbing your peace, there are some steps you can follow to help resolve the issue. The first step to take is to try and talk with your neighbor. Many people are unaware that their dog barks when they are absent. They may not be aware that their dog's barking is bothering you. Speaking with the dog guardian often solves the problem. If you are uncomfortable speaking with your neighbor, a polite note placed on the front door or mailed to the address can help make them aware of the problem. While the city does recommend trying to solve the dispute with your neighbor to reach an amiable solution on your own, speaking with your neighbor is a suggestion and not a requirement when dealing with barking dogs. If attempting to address the barking dog problem on your own fails, call the Boulder Police Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report the problem. Be prepared to provide Animal Protection with the following information: the address of the barking dog; exact date(s) and time(s) of the barking, preferably the most recent occurrence; and a description of the dog(s), if you can provide one. The City of Boulder has a two-step process when dealing with nuisance dogs. Once you have provided the necessary information, Boulder Police Animal Protection will contact the dog's guardian and issue a written warning. Animal Protection will meet with the guardian in person to help them identify what is causing the barking and try to find a solution. In accordance with city ordinance, a written warning must be issued prior to a summons being served. After the warning is issued, give the guardian 10 to 14 days to identify the cause and possible resolutions to the nuisance barking. Many times, guardians need to utilize trial and error to discover which bark-control methods work best for their dog If the written warning is not successful and additional enforcement action must be taken, two reporting parties are required for a court summons to be issued. The reporting parties will need to complete witness statements for the same date/time/duration for a court summons to be issued."
Animal Noise (Barking Dogs),Animals,Police ,Why do dogs bark?,"Dogs bark for many reasons, and determining what causes the barking is the first tool to begin to resolve the problem behavior. Some common reasons that dogs bark are listed below. Boredom/loneliness -  Dogs are pack animals, are not solitary, and do not like to be left alone. They need a lot of attention and stimulation. Territorial/protection - Dogs will bark at people or animals that come near their territory to get them to leave. This can often appear to be aggressive behavior. Separation anxiety -  Dogs with separation anxiety often bark excessively when left alone. Dogs who have separation anxiety will often pace and exhibit destructive behavior. Alarm/fear - Some dogs will bark at anything that startles them or catches their attention. There are many things throughout a day that may startle a dog. Be a good neighbor. A barking dog can be disruptive to your neighbors and can put a strain on your relationship. It can also lead to a court summons if allowed to continue. There are many ways to help curb your dog's barking. A few common methods are listed below. Give your dog a special toy or long-lasting treat to entertain them while you are away. Daily exercise will stimulate your dog both physically and mentally, making them a much calmer, more enjoyable pet. Ultra-sonic bark control devices are typically placed outside around the yard and emit a high-pitched sound every time the dog barks. Citronella bark collars spray an unpleasant smell towards the dog's nose every time they bark. Electronic bark collars emit a static electric charge when the dog is barking."
"Animal Protection, Rules and Regulations",Animals,Police ,"Animal Protection, Rules and Regulations","Animal Protection Please contact Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint. Boulder Animal Protection is a division of the Boulder Police Department that enforces all city ordinances related to animals and state laws related to domestic animals. Animal Protection responds to animal-related complaints and promotes responsible pet ownership through enforcement, mediation and education. Officers investigate and respond to: roaming dogs; dangerous or aggressive animals; animal bites; cruelty and/or neglect to animals; animal noise (barking dogs); excess animal feces; leash law and tethering violations; dog licensing violations; and injured and orphaned small wildlife. Animal Rules and Regulations The City of Boulder's animal laws were developed to ensure the health and safety of residents and their pets. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. Leash law All dogs in the City of Boulder must be kept on leashes at all times unless they are confined to their owner's property. Dogs that roam loose present a danger to the community and may be hit by a car or attacked by other animals. An exception for your dog to run free is to utilize one of the designated off-leash dog parks. If you have obtained an Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag for your dog, you must utilize the designated opens space areas that are participating in that program. Rabies vaccination City of Boulder law requires all dogs and cats over the age of four months to be vaccinated against rabies. After the initial vaccination, animals must be kept current on rabies vaccinations using either a one-year or three-year vaccination. All vaccinations must be provided by a Colorado-licensed veterinarian. City of Boulder dog licenseA City of Boulder dog license is required for all dogs over the age of four months living within the city limits. The license serves as identification to enable officers to contact you if your dog is lost or injured, and to ensure that your dog is currently vaccinated against rabies. The license must be obtained within 30 days of acquiring the dog or within 30 days of moving to Boulder. In order to purchase a city dog license, a guardian must provide proof of a current rabies vaccination. All dogs are required to wear their City of Boulder dog license tag on their collar or harness at all times. Keep in mind that the Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag is not a substitute for a city dog license. Aggressive animals No person shall own or keep any aggressive animal. An aggressive animal is one that approaches a person in a vicious or terrorizing attitude of attack. An animal that bites, claws, or attempts to bite or claw any person, or bites or injures another animal, will be considered a vicious animal. Be sure to keep your pets under control at all times to prevent an incident such as an attack or bite. Animal cruelty or neglect All animals in Boulder are legally protected from being abandoned, beaten, tortured, injured, transported in an unsafe manner, or killed. Failure to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, grooming, opportunity for exercise, or sanitary conditions is a violation of city ordinance. Violators will be strictly prosecuted for these infractions. Barking dog nuisance Boulder's animal noise ordinance states that it is unlawful for an owner to allow an animal to disturb the peace with loud and habitual barking, howling, whining, or baying. If you notice that your dog barks unnecessarily, it is your responsibility to identify the problem and resolve it immediately to prevent a disturbance to your neighborhood. Clean up after your animal. Picking up your pet's waste is required by city ordinance. It is an important way to help preserve our environment and prevent the spread of disease. Please be courteous to other Boulder community members by cleaning up after your pet. Cats While not subject to leash and licensing laws, cats must be vaccinated against rabies beginning at four months of age. Cats must also be restrained from creating a nuisance by leaving feces or damaging the property of another. If a cat is causing a nuisance by defecating or destroying property, a property owner has the legal right to remove the cat from their property and bring it to the local animal shelter. The guardian may also be charged with owning a nuisance cat. Impound and board fees apply to impounded cats. Strict liability Boulder animal laws are strict liability laws. Therefore, an animal's guardian is liable even when there is no proof of negligence or intent. The guardian is responsible for their animal's actions, regardless of the circumstances, accidental or otherwise. If an animal injures, kills, or damages any person, other animal, or property, the strict liability law holds the guardian or keeper of the animal legally responsible, and includes all costs and damages incurred. Penalties In addition to impoundment fees, guardians are subject to a court summons for violations of the city animal ordinances. The maximum penalty for each violation is $1,000 and/or 90 days in jail. Fines are subject to increase for subsequent violations."

Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Bears,"Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) has provided this list of frequently asked questions about bear management in the City of Boulder. The CPW is responsible for the direct management of all wildlife in the state. For more information, visit the Living with Bears in Colorado webpage."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why are there bears in Boulder?,"The land surrounding Boulder, including Open Space and Mountain Parks, U.S. Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties, and the mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for bears. Bears find food in the form of garbage, compost, bird seed, barbecue grills, pet food, and fruit from trees. There is an abundance of water from various creeks, ditches, wetlands and backyard water features (fountains and ponds). Bear sightings are most common west of Broadway, but it is not uncommon for bears to be seen in the east part of Boulder."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Do we have grizzly bears in Colorado?,"No, all bears in Colorado are black bears, regardless of whether the coat is black, brown, blond or cinnamon-colored. The last confirmed grizzly bear in Colorado was seen in 1979."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why can't CPW take all of the bears out of town and keep them out?,"There is no simple way to keep bears out of the city. Because abundant, high-quality habitat exists around the City of Boulder, there will always be bears in town to some extent. In some cases, bears in Boulder may be relocated, though this often is not an ideal solution. Young bears may be somewhat more likely to stay in the area they are moved to. There are, as of yet, no proven techniques to exclude bears from large areas like Boulder, though minimizing human attractants and food sources does help."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,"What is the two strike policy, and what does it mean if a bear is ear-tagged?","The CPW has a ""two-strike"" policy under which bears may be tranquilized, ear-tagged and relocated once if they are in an inappropriate location (for example, too far into town), or they have engaged in episode(s) of ""nuisance"" behavior (multiple visits to town, light property damage, etc.). If that same bear has to be physically dealt with again (tranquilized or trapped due to inappropriate location or nuisance behavior), the bear is put down. Bears that pose a public safety risk will be put down regardless of whether they have ear tags or not."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What does CPW do about bears in town? When are they relocated or killed?,"The response from CPW will depend on a variety of factors such as location, time of day, history of the bear in town, whether the bear is already ear-tagged, and current behavior. In these cases, the CPW will educate the neighborhood about bear attractants, often via media releases, volunteers going door-to-door and posting signs. Hazing of bears in Boulder (using air horns, banging pots and pans, yelling) is also encouraged in order to make the bear feel uncomfortable around humans. If the bear is in a location where it can be left unbothered, the CPW will often notify immediate neighbors and leave it alone, or leave it with a city or CPW ""bear-sitter"" who can keep an eye on the bear and notify neighbors when the bear moves. That bear will often move back onto open space on its own, usually after dark. Capturing the bear is a last resort, and will only be attempted if less-intensive management options are not effective or appropriate. If the bear has not been captured before, it will be ear-tagged and relocated. If the bear is already ear-tagged, it will be put down. Bears considered to be a public safety risk will not be relocated, but will be put down regardless of whether they are ear-tagged or not."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,"What can I do to keep myself, my kids and my pets safe?","Educate yourself and everyone in your house about bears about how to reduce attractants on your property and in your neighborhood. A great place to start is the Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) website. The CPW recommends that children be supervised when outside in bear, mountain lion and coyote habitat. The risk of injury or death to humans, including children, from bears, is low. Teach your children to be aware of wildlife and what to do if they encounter wildlife. An easy acronym to remember is SMART: S - Stop, do not run. M - Make yourself look big. A - Announce ""Leave me alone!"" R - Retreat - back away slowly. T - Tell an adult. Practicing scenarios ahead of time can better prepare children for an unexpected encounter with wildlife, including bears. Bears do not usually bother pets or target them as food items, and are often afraid of dogs."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How can I reduce the chance of a bear coming onto or near my property?,"Containing food items and other smelly attractants is the best way to reduce the chances that bears will show interest in your property. When bears successfully seek out human food sources, it increases the chances they will repeatedly come into the City of Boulder to forage. Garbage and compost should be kept in a shed or garage until the morning of pickup, or kept in a bear-resistant trash container so that the bear will not be able to access the food items. Birdfeeders should either be removed from April through November or hung in such a manner that prevents bears from accessing it. Pet food should not be left outside and should be removed as soon as your pet has finished eating. Barbeque grills should be stored in a garage or cleaned thoroughly after each use. The fruit trees that grow in many parts of Boulder can serve as an attractant to bears from mid-summer into the fall. CPW recommends that residents pick up fallen fruit on a regular basis and reconsider planting new fruit trees. Residents can also pick fruit on trees to further minimize attractants. Backyard ponds can serve as an attractant to bears, particularly in the warmer months. Residents concerned about bears near their property should consider draining these ponds. Reducing bear attractants is a community effort, and talking with your neighbors about the importance of keeping attractants contained will benefit both people and bears."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,When are bears most active? Is it unusual to see a bear in the middle of the day?,"Bears are generally most active at dusk, throughout the night, and into the dawn hours. This is often when they are foraging and moving around. However, it is not unusual or abnormal to see bears in the middle of the day. In the fall months, bears need to feed up to 20 hours a day to prepare for hibernation. Hibernation dates can vary depending on the weather, available food sources, and the individual bear, but bears generally will enter hibernation in mid-late November and emerge in early-mid April."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What do bears eat?,"Bears are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of plant and animal materials. Potential food sources include garbage, compost, bird seed, food from barbecue grills, pet food left outside, and fruit from trees. Bears are frequent visitors because all of these attractants exist within Boulder."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why can't we feed bears to keep them out of town?,"CPW does not feed bears outside of Boulder during difficult years because it does not solve the problem of bears coming into town and doing so is bad for the bears. Natural food is difficult, but it is not impossible, to find. Feeding bears reduces their motivation and ability to find food, which may cause bears to become dependent on artificial feeding stations for survival. A single habitat can only support a certain number of bears in a given year. If the CPW were to artificially increase the availability of food for bears around Boulder by feeding them, it would artificially increase local bear populations through a higher breeding success rate and lower mortality."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What are the risks to humans from bears?,"During the last several decades, there have been three fatalities and 37 incidents in which a person was injured by a black bear in Colorado. Many of these incidents involved the bear either being intentionally fed or being unintentionally habituated to people. There are many things you can do to lower the risk of injury from bears, including removing any attractants around your home and staying alert and aware when you are in any forest, park, or open space area."
Bears,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What is considered aggressive bear behavior?,"Many times what appears to be aggressive behavior of bears is more likely defensive behavior. When they feel threatened, defensive bears will: ""pop"" their jaws; make low moaning sounds; ""huff"" or exhale quickly to try to demonstrate that they are ""tough and strong;"" and/or ""false charge"" by running at the threat but stopping before they reach it. Aggressive behavior is rare in black bears. Examples of aggressive behavior would be if a bear, despite having easy ways to escape, approached people or if a bear entered a tent and injured someone."

The reimbursement process is governed by state statutes and regulations and does not apply to personal property, including fences, garages, cars, or most other objects that a bear might damage within the Boulder city limits."

Cats in Boulder,Animals,Police ,Cats in Boulder,"Please contact Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint. In the City of Boulder, cats are considered free-roaming animals and leash and licensing laws do not apply to them. Cats are subject to vaccination, nuisance and aggressive animal laws. Animal Protection cannot pick up stray cats unless they are sick, injured, have attacked a domestic animal, or have bitten or attacked a person. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. Vaccinate All cats must be vaccinated against rabies, beginning at four months of age. After the initial vaccination, animals must be kept current on rabies vaccinations using either a one-year or three-year vaccination. Properly vaccinating your animal helps protect them and your family from disease. Nuisance cats Don't allow your cat to create a nuisance or damage private property. Cats may dig up flower beds, leave feces in unwanted areas, or even kill wildlife. If a cat is causing a nuisance by defecating or destroying property, a property owner has the legal right to remove the cat from their property and bring it to a local animal shelter. Aggressive behavior Cats are not permitted to behave in an aggressive manner, which includes biting, scratching, attacking, or otherwise intimidating another. If your cat is displaying these behaviors, they may be subject to impoundment and you may be charged with harboring an aggressive animal. If your cat is impounded due to the above infractions, impound and board fees may apply. The cat's guardian may also be charged with a violation of owning a nuisance cat or aggressive animal, which would result in a court summons. Penalties can result in monetary fines and other restrictions. Keep your cat healthy and safe Protect your cats from the potential threats and diseases of the outdoors by keeping them inside. Chemical hazards Cats can come into contact with many different poisons while roaming outdoors. Lawn fertilizers, pesticides and rat poisons are just a few hazards. Predators Outdoor cats can be killed or seriously injured by dogs, other stray cats, or wildlife. Traffic hazards Every year, Boulder Animal Protection picks up cats that have been struck and killed by vehicles. Always spay and neuter Spay and neuter your cats to prevent house spraying, female heat cycles and overpopulation. Spaying and neutering also helps curb the cats' need to roam and makes them more enjoyable housemates. Helpful tips Many people think that cats need to be let outdoors in order to be happy. Cats live longer, healthier, happier lives when kept indoors. The average lifespan for outdoor cats is three to five years, whereas the average lifespan for indoor cats is 15 to 20 years. Outdoor cats often get into fights with other cats, leading to wounds and abscesses that are painful and costly to treat. Eliminate boredom and encourage exercise by providing cat scratch posts, catnip toys, laser pointers, anything that catches your cats' attention and encourages the ""hunting"" instinct. Window perches are also a great way to give your cat a view of the outside world without actually going outside. Outdoor cats are exposed to various diseases by various animals such as raccoons, skunks, and other unvaccinated cats. Make sure your cat is vaccinated against rabies, feline panleukopenia (feline distemper), and feline leukemia.   Feral cats A feral cat is a descendant of a domesticated cat that has returned to the wild. Feral cats can live any place where there is food and shelter available. Make sure you don't leave food accessible for feral cats to eat. Repair any holes in house skirting and make sure there is no access under porches or the house foundation. If you are experiencing feral cat problems in your neighborhood, there are several options to help resolve the issue. Option 1 - Trap and transport the cat to the Humane Society of Boulder Valley. This method is often not effective. Removing one or multiple cats without removing the food sources and shelter will only make room for more feral cats to move in. Option 2 -Trap, neuter and release. This consists of trapping feral cats and having them altered, vaccinated, and returned to the location they came from. Neutering and spaying the cats stops repopulation, territorial marking, yowling and fighting. With established cats in the area, no new cats will move in. Here are a few Colorado organizations that assist communities with trap, neuter and release programs.

Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,"In November 2014, Boulder voters approved a ballot measure that exempts Boulder from state limitations on broadband services. Now the city is exploring opportunities to offer enhanced access to the Internet to residents, businesses and visitors. Learn more about Connect Boulder."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Is the City of Boulder planning to create a public broadband utility?,"Not at this time. Voters' passage of the ballot measure allows the city to begin exploring options to make its assets available to serve the broadband needs of Boulder residents, students and businesses, most likely through a public-private partnership, but conceivably through providing direct services. Even if the city eventually made plans to create a broadband utility, it would not prevent existing companies from continuing to provide broadband services."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,So what is the city doing?,"As Boulder explores its options, the city is moving forward with some of the less complicated enhancements, such as providing free, public Wi-Fi access in outdoor public spaces. The first such initiative will be in the Civic Area park. The go-live date for this is Tuesday, April 7, 2015. This service will allow anyone with a smartphone, Wi-Fi enabled computer or tablet to access the Internet without incurring data usage charges."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,How can I access this network?,"Once the network is live, accessing it should be easy. Go to your device's wireless configuration settings. Select the wireless network named ""ConnectBoulder."" Review the user agreement and click ""Accept."" Browse to your heart's content."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Where can I see a map of the coverage area?,A map is available at Connect Boulder.
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Are there filters on the city's Wi-Fi network?,"No. The city believes in the value of a free and open exchange of ideas, information and perspectives. You will, however, encounter a ""splash screen"" that includes information about responsible use, including a prohibition against accessing the network to conduct criminal activity."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Has the city consider possible health risks associated with Wi-Fi and associated transmitters?,"The City of Boulder takes public health very seriously. Based on federal guidelines, however, we are confident that our efforts to increase the community's access to the Internet do not pose a substantial risk. The FCC has a certification process that ensures that devices like those used in this project do not exceed guidelines for human exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.   The access points that are being deployed in the Civic Area, a location that already has WiFi access inside most buildings, have a power output of close to 1 watt.   This is far less power than what you might find at a typical radio broadcast site and is well within the acceptable range."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,How will other possibilities be evaluated?,"The city will be working with consultants and IT professionals to evaluate options that could benefit our community. In addition, Boulder has created a working group of advisors who represent a variety of stakeholders to help vet ideas and understand challenges. More information about this group, including a list of members, agendas and meeting materials, is available at Connect Boulder. Large-scale projects may require the approval of City Council."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,What is Colorado Senate Bill 152?,"Colorado Senate Bill 152 (SB-152) is a measure passed by the Colorado Legislature in 2005. Among other requirements, it requires local governments to secure voter approval before entering into the broadband business. The current law limits the ability of Colorado cities to provide a broad spectrum of services, including: free Internet service in city libraries, parks and community centers; partnering with private businesses and leveraging government infrastructure to provide affordable and high-speed Internet service throughout the entire community; and direct provision of broadband services by municipal governments."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,How is the exemption from SB-152 expected to benefit the Boulder community?,"Voters' approval of ballot measure 2C, an exemption from SB-152, restored to Boulder the autonomy that all Colorado cities had prior to 2005, especially local authority to facilitate the provision of community broadband services by leveraging the city's physical assets and leasing, selling capacity, or granting similar rights to one or more private providers. Boulder's highly educated citizens use the Internet for activities ranging from world-class climate research, to online learning and collaboration, to home entertainment. Boulder is the ideal place to install high-speed broadband because of its tech-savvy population and innovative businesses. Teleworking and home-based businesses are common in Boulder, and would significantly benefit from increased broadband speed."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,What are some of the expected benefits of high-speed broadband services in Boulder?,"Intensified Innovation by local businesses and entrepreneurs who are already nationally recognized for spurring new startups, ideas, and technologies. Better access to high-speed broadband will increase the city's ability to retain companies that need and demand this level of service. A More Connected Community with new avenues for citizen engagement in local decision-making, new frontiers for digital governance, and new opportunities for wired social spaces and creative networking. Enhanced Efficiency and Improved Quality of Life, as Boulder residents and businesses are able to do more, more quickly, with less frustration; leaving more time for enjoying the great outdoors. Inclusive Internet Access as the City of Boulder works with partners like the University of Colorado, Boulder Valley School District and Boulder Community Foundation to ensure that everyone in the community is wired, connected, and empowered to participate, innovate, and succeed, eliminating the digital divide. Cuts in Carbon as high-speed connections empower employees to more effectively work from home and local businesses are better able to support clients worldwide, without having to get on a plane. Attachment A of the June 17 City Council memo provides key information in support of Boulder's need for greater autonomy and local control over public technology investment decisions."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,"Why didn't the city try to repeal SB-152 at the state legislature, rather than asking Boulder voters to consider an exemption?",Recent City of Boulder attempts to amend SB-152 proved impossible because of other broadband-related priorities in the statehouse.
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Don't existing cable and Internet companies provide high-speed Internet in Boulder?,"As in many other Colorado communities, Boulder residents and businesses have a limited choice of broadband providers. Existing providers have few incentives to provide the more affordable and higher-speed services that might otherwise exist in a more competitive environment. Voters' approval of an exemption of SB-152 does not prohibit either existing or new broadband providers from competing in the Boulder broadband market."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,What is broadband fiber?,"Broadband fiber is fiber-optic cable, typically run underground. Fiber carries passive, symmetrical signals via modulated light. Fiber-optic connections are very reliable and can quickly carry large amounts of data over long distances. Fiber-optic speeds range from 10 megabits to 10 gigabits per second, compared to 20 to 100 megabits per second for a typical cable Internet connection. Fiber-optic cable provides a symmetrical connection, allowing data to flow in both directions simultaneously with no reduction in speed. Unlike cable Internet, fiber-optic cable is a dedicated Internet connection and is not shared with cable services."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Does the city own existing broadband fiber in Boulder?,The city currently has ownership or rights to more than 100 miles of conduit and some dark fiber (fiber-optics not connected to broadband equipment) that could used to benefit the community.
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Why does Boulder need faster Internet service?,"Access to broadband service is no longer a luxury, but increasingly a fundamental need for Colorado residents, students and businesses. Broadband service has become similar to other basic services such as clean water, safe roads, and public schools. Broadband technology has advanced significantly since 2005, particularly the technology that enables what Boulder residents and businesses regard as ""high-speed"" broadband service. Broadband fiber increases Internet connection and browsing speeds, allowing users to more quickly access online information and resources."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Are other Colorado cities exempt from SB-152?,"Voters in nearly a dozen Colorado cities and counties have exempted themselves from SB-152, passing measures affirming their communities' rights to provide certain broadband services. Exemptions approved by the voters on Nov. 4, 2014 in Boulder, Wray, Yuma, Cherry Hills Village, Red Cliff, Yuma County, San Miguel County, and Rio Blanco County appear to have been inspired by similar ballot measures years prior in Centennial, Montrose, and Longmont. Dozens of other states in the U.S. and many other countries allow and encourage local governments to be actively involved in the provision of broadband services."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Was this a vote for Google Fiber?,"No, Google Fiber is Google's fiber-to-the-premises service in the U.S., providing broadband Internet and television to a small and slowly growing number of communities. The City of Boulder, with the help of a broad community coalition, responded to Google's initial competitive selection process in 2010, advocating to be selected as a ""Google Fiber City."" More than 1,100 other communities also applied to be the first recipient of the service. The Google Fiber service was first introduced to Kansas City, Kansas, and is being expanded to Kansas City, Missouri, with plans to expand to several other Kansas City suburbs. Google Fiber is also being expanded to Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In February 2014, Google announced that the company had chosen another 34 cities in nine metro areas as candidates for future expansion."
Connect Boulder Wi-Fi,City Technology,Innovation and Technology ,Is the City of Boulder planning to partner with Google to provide broadband services?,"Although the ballot measure was not offered in anticipation of a specific city-sponsored telecommunications initiative or public-private partnership, the background and justification provided during the 2010 Google Fiber initiative underscores Boulder's opportunity to apply its unique assets and define its digital future."

This will cost you additional money and time. The Boulder Municipal Court does not accept any online classes."
Court ordered classes (MIP),Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,How will I know which class to take?,"Everyone charged as a Minor in Possession of Alcohol or Marijuana (MIP) is required to complete a substance use screen. The results of that screen, together with other factors in your case, will be considered in determining which class you are assigned to. It is important that you answer the screen honestly. If the circumstances of your case suggest you have not been candid, you could be ordered to undergo an evaluation at your expense. If you are a University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) student, you will also be contacted by the Office of Student Conduct. If you live in a residence hall, your Student Conduct violation may be addressed through Residence Life. CU and Boulder Police provide copies of all tickets filed in the Boulder Municipal Court to the Office of Student Conduct. If you admit or are found in violation of the Student Code of Conduct as a result of your MIP case, the office of Student Conduct will require you to complete a substance use class. If you have received your Student Conduct decision letter before your court date, please come to court prepared to show that letter to the judge that indicates which class Student Conduct has ordered and the judge will likely order the same class. Make sure you know the name of the class such as SBIRT, BASICS1, BASICS2, or BASICS3/DARMA. It is not enough to know that the class is at CU Health Promotions, as almost all CU substance classes are offered at CU Health Promotions. The court needs to see that decision letter. If your MIP case is your second substance-related Student Conduct violation, you should make every effort to be seen by Student Conduct before court, as these are the cases where the court and CU are most likely to order different classes. CU students will need to complete whichever class is more intensive - the class ordered by the court or the class ordered by the Office of Student Conduct/Residence Life. Class locationAnyone can take the assigned class at Boulder County Public Health. If you are a current CU-Boulder student, you may also take your class at CU Health Promotions on the CU campus. Contact them for current class openings. If you do not live or work in or near Boulder, the court will usually allow you to take a class closer to where you live. Court staff have information about acceptable classes offered in the State of Colorado.

Defenses in Municipal Court Traffic Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,"I committed a traffic violation, but I did not intend to do it. Can I still be found guilty?","In most cases, yes. Most municipal traffic violations are ""strict liability"" offenses. This means the City of Boulder does not have to prove you intended to commit the violation or that you had any ""culpable mental state."" That is, the city need not prove you acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently; the city must only prove that you committed a prohibited act or failed to perform a required act. Put simply, a defendant can be found guilty of a strict liability offense even if he or she did not intend to commit the offense. Failing to stop at a stop sign is an example of a strict liability offense. If you did not see the stop sign and therefore failed to stop, you did not intend to run the stop sign. Nevertheless, you failed to stop as required and are therefore guilty of the violation. Speeding is another strict liability offense. You may not realize how fast you were going and you may not have intended to exceed the speed limit, but nevertheless you are guilty of speeding if you exceed the posted limit."
Defenses in Municipal Court Traffic Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What if I was speeding because my speedometer was not working properly?,"It does not matter because the city is not required to prove you knew you were speeding. Moreover, Section 7-2-7 of the Boulder Revised Code (B.R.C.) provides that mechanical failure of any kind is not a defense to a strict liability traffic violation."
Defenses in Municipal Court Traffic Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What if I caused an accident because my vehicle's brakes failed?,"Again, mechanical failure is not a defense for a strict liability traffic offense. The law requires drivers to keep their vehicles in proper condition at all times. Mechanical failure could be relevant in traffic cases that require the city to prove the defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, because mechanical failure would tend to show the defendant lacked the required culpable mental state."
Defenses in Municipal Court Traffic Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,Are all traffic violations strict liability offenses?,"No, while most municipal traffic violations are strict liability offenses, there are several offenses that require the city to prove that the driver possessed a culpable mental state to obtain a conviction. For example, to prove a charge of inattentive driving, the city must prove that the defendant drove in a careless, inattentive, negligent or imprudent manner. Similarly, to prove a charge of reckless driving, the city must prove that the defendant demonstrated a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, or violated one of the other provisions of the reckless driving ordinance."
Defenses in Municipal Court Traffic Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What if I committed a traffic violation in order to avoid an accident?,"Necessity is a defense if and only if the following conditions are met: the driver committed the violation as reasonably necessary to an emergency response compelled by the necessity of avoiding an imminent traffic hazard about to occur by reason of a traffic situation occasioned or developed through no misconduct, fault or omission of the driver; the driver had been obeying all relevant traffic laws prior to the time such driver discovered or reasonably should have discovered the hazard; and the hazard was of sufficient gravity that, according to all ordinary standards of careful driving, the desirability and urgency of avoiding the hazard through violating the traffic law by the means employed clearly outweighed the desirability of avoiding the hazard through lawful driving alternatives. Note that necessity is not a defense if you were partly responsible of creating the hazard in the first place."
Defenses in Municipal Court Traffic Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,"My vehicle collided with the car in front of me, but I feel the driver of that vehicle caused the accident by failing to obey the law. Is that a defense?","In some cases, it could be. If you are charged with failing to avoid interfering with the vehicle ahead of you in violation of Section 7-4-55 of the B.R.C., it is an affirmative defense to the charge that the driver of the other vehicle violated any ordinance governing right-of-way, turning, passing, or parking, and the other driver's violation was the proximate cause of the collision or interference. Other defenses in Boulder Municipal Court traffic casesThere may be other defenses applicable to specific charges. The defense of malfunctioning traffic signal is governed by Section 7-4-8 of the B.R.C., which differs somewhat from the state statute."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,"What is a ""strict liability"" offense?","A strict liability offense does not require the City of Boulder to prove the defendant had a ""culpable mental state"" in order to obtain a conviction. That is, the city need not prove the defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently. The city must only prove that the defendant committed a prohibited act or failed to perform a required act. Put simply, a defendant can be found guilty of a strict liability offense even if he or she did not intend to commit the offense."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What types of offenses are strict liability offenses?,"Many traffic violations are strict liability offenses. Similarly, many code violations pertaining to land use, zoning, trash, occupancy, weeds, and keeping sidewalks free of snow are also strict liability offenses."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,How can I tell whether the offense I am charged with is a strict liability offense?,"The best way is to read the specific ordinance within the Boulder Revised Code. Unless the ordinance requires the city to prove you acted intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, it is probably a strict liability offense. If you are not sure, you should ask the judge in open court."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,May a landlord be held liable for violations on the landlord's property resulting from the acts or omissions of the landlord's tenants?,"Yes, if the offense is a strict liability offense. Section 9-10-1(f) of the Boulder Revised Code (B.R.C.) provides that the owner, tenant, and occupant of a structure or land, and the agents of each of them, are jointly and severally liable for any violation of Boulder's land use regulations with respect to that structure or land."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,That does not seem fair. What is the rationale for that?,"The courts have recognized that, in regulating public health and safety, there are sound public policy reasons for classifying certain offenses as strict liability offenses. In the case of landlords and tenants, for example, holding landlords strictly liable for violations on their property resulting from the acts or omissions of their tenants gives landlords an incentive to supervise their tenants."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,Is self-defense a defense to a charge of third-degree assault or brawling?,"It could be; however, your definition of self-defense may be different than the legal definition. Self-defense is not a defense if two people enter into a fight by mutual agreement. Please review Section 5-2-17, B.R.C."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,Is self-defense a defense to a charge of harassment?,"No, harassment is a specific intent crime. If you were acting in self-defense, then by definition, you did not intend to harass, annoy or alarm another person."
Defenses in Non-Traffic Municipal Court Cases,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,Is intoxication a defense?,"Generally, voluntary intoxication is not a defense. See Section 5-2-24, B.R.C. Other defenses in non-traffic Boulder Municipal Court casesSome of the other legal defenses that may be available in some cases are set forth in Title 5, Chapter 2, of the Boulder Revised Code."
Discrimination,Legal,Human Services ,Discrimination,"The City of Boulder human rights ordinance is a local law that protects against illegal discrimination within the city limits of Boulder. The ordinance specifically affords legal protection against discrimination in three areas: housing; employment; and public accommodation. Within these three areas, the ordinance prohibits discrimination based on ancestry, color, creed, gender variance, genetic characteristics, marital status, mental disability, physical disability, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation. In housing, it also prohibits discrimination based on custody of a minor child, parenthood and pregnancy. In employment, it also prohibits discrimination based on age, specifically between the ages of 40 and 65 years old. For more information, read Boulder Revised Code Chapter 12-1: Prohibition of Discrimination in Housing, Employment, and Public Accommodations, or contact the Community Relations and Office of Human Rights staff at 303-441-3141."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why are disposable checkout bags a problem?,"Boulder currently uses approximately 33 million checkout bags a year, or about 342 bags/person/year. Plastic bags are produced from non-renewable resources, are difficult to recycle (they cannot go in Boulder's curbside bins), and contaminate our recycling facility equipment. Plastic bags do not biodegrade, so they remain as litter in the environment. Paper bags are recyclable, but take a very large amount of water and energy to produce. The disposable bag fee helps mitigate these problems by charging a fee to consumers that choose to use disposable bags."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,When did the disposable bag fee ordinance take effect?,"The ordinance took effect on July 1, 2013."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How much is the fee?,The fee is 10 cents per plastic or paper bag used at the checkout.
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What kind of bags does the fee apply to?,"The fee is only charged on plastic or paper bags used at the checkout - it does not apply to bags used inside stores such as produce bags, bulk food bags, or bags used to wrap meat or fish. It also does not apply to newspaper bags or bags provide by pharmacists."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Has this type of ordinance been implemented elsewhere?,"Yes. Similar regulation (a fee on both paper and plastic bags) was implemented in Washington D.C. in 2009 and has been very successful. Aspen, Telluride, and Basalt are examples of cities in Colorado that also have ordinances in place to reduce the use of disposable bags. A listing of other communities with similar ordinances is available at PlasticBagLaws.org."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Is banning bags still a possibility?,The disposable bag fee is a first step toward the goal of eventually moving away from disposable bag use in Boulder. The effectiveness of the fee will be monitored and other options may be evaluated in the future if the desired results are not achieved.
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why not switch to biodegradable bags?,"The goal of this ordinance is to reduce the use of disposable bags in general, not to shift from one type of single-use item to another. Instead of providing an alternative disposable option, the wants to encourage using reusable bags, therefore biodegradable bags are not exempt from the bag fee. In addition, many ""biodegradable"" bags to not properly break down in the local composting facilities, and do not break down at all in the landfill. Biodegradable shopping bags are currently very cost-prohibitive for stores to use and do not have the durability that traditional plastic bags do."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What stores have to collect the bag fee?,"The fee is only charged at ""food stores,"" defined in the ordinance as those who are within the city limits, operate year-round, and sell a line of staple foodstuffs, meats, produce, dairy products or other perishable items. This does not include temporary vendors, vendors at farmers markets, or businesses at which food is not a significant source of revenue."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why not charge the fee at all stores?,"Approximately 60-70 percent of the bags used in Boulder come from grocery stores. Applying the bag fee to all retail stores in Boulder was an option considered by City Council; however, doing so would have greatly increased the costs to administer and collect the fee. By applying the fee to the main source of disposable bag use, the ordinance will cost-effectively target a majority of the bags. The fee will be monitored and can be applied to more stores in the future."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How will the fee impact low-income populations?,"The fee does not apply to anyone who participates in a federal or state food assistance program. In addition, a portion of the revenue collected from the fee will go toward purchasing reusable bags that were distributed in advance of July 1 to the community, including low-income populations in Boulder."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why don't we just promote recycling plastic bags?,"Plastic bags are very difficult to recycle due to the limited aftermarkets for the material. They must be clean, dry, and placed in a collection container specifically for bags. These containers are available at most grocery stores and at the Center for Hard-to-Recycle Materials (CHaRM). They cannot be recycled in Boulder's single stream curbside program, and cause a lot of problems when residents put their recyclables in them. They clog the machinery that sort our recyclables, resulting in equipment shut-downs so that they can be cut out by hand."
Disposable Bag Fee,"Composting, Recycling and Waste",Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Where is the revenue from the fee going?,"The stores keep four cents of the fee to order to cover their costs complying with the ordinance, training employees, etc. The remaining six cents is remitted to the City of Boulder for uses stated in the ordinance, including: Administrative costs associated with developing and implementing the fee; Providing reusable bags to the community; Educating residents, businesses and visitors about the impacts of disposable bags; Funding programs and infrastructure that allow the community to reduce waste associated with disposable bags; Purchase and install equipment to minimize bag pollution, such as recycling containers; Fund community cleanup events; and Mitigate the effects of disposable bags on the city's drainage system and environment. * No disposable bag fees collected in accordance with this ordinance can be used for general government purposes."

Dog Parks and Dog Swimming,Animals,Parks and Recreation ,Dog Parks and Dog Swimming,"Dog Park Information:  The City of Boulder has four dog parks: East Boulder Dog Park; Foothills Dog Park; Howard Hueston Dog Park; and Valmont Dog Park. Dog park rules and etiquette All City of Boulder ordinances apply in dog parks. Dog guardians must be present within the fenced enclosure and are responsible and liable for the behavior of their dogs at all times. Dog guardians are responsible for cleaning up and properly disposing of dog waste. Dogs must be currently vaccinated and display either a city or county dog license. Dog guardians must have a leash for each dog in their possession. Aggressive animals are prohibited. Dog guardians are responsible for obeying all park rules. The city recommends that puppies under four months old not use the dog park because they have not yet received their full inoculations to protect them from parvo-virus and other diseases. Female dogs in heat can cause dog fights and aggressive behavior. Please leave your female dog at home during periods of intense heat. Aggression in dogs can increase when they are leashed, especially when encountered by off-leash dogs. Please evaluate your dogs prior to bringing them to the dog park, ensuring that they are well-socialized so that they can be off leash in this area. At no time should you bring more than four dogs to a dog park - this is beyond the possible ""span of control"" to ensure a safe and happy experience for everyone. Please consider how many dogs are using the dog park before you bring your own dogs inside. You might consider adjusting your schedule if you have multiple dogs so that other visitors are not overwhelmed. The double gate is provided for your dog's safety. Please make sure you close the first gate entirely before you open the second gate so that the dog is in a safe enclosure during the transition from leash to off-leash. Dogs differ in their tolerance of other dogs playing with their toys or food. Please look around and coordinate with other visitors to make sure that a thrown toy does not start a fight. Minimize loud noises (such as dogs barking or humans shouting) so that you do not disrupt others. Be considerate of other visitors' needs and concerns. People may be using the fenced area to train their dogs as well as play with them. Dogs may also be older, fragile or sick. Greet, then meet!

Dog Parks and Dog Swimming,Animals,Parks and Recreation ,Can I bring my dog to the Boulder Reservoir?,"Dog are only allowed on the south shore of the Boulder Reservoir during the off-season from Labor Day to May 15. Dogs are allowed outside the south shore area on established trails and roads year-round, but leash laws do apply. The potential for conflicts during the busy season on the south shore makes dog management difficult, and thus it is not allowed. As always, guardians are responsible for picking up after dogs. Dog waste and composting In all areas, dog guardians are responsible for picking up and removing dog waste. This is not only the law, it helps to keep dog parks clean, water sources uncontaminated, and your shoes free of unwanted smells! There is dog waste composting available at Valmont Dog Park."

Voice and Sight Tag Program  The Voice and Sight Tag program is designed to help dog guardians understand and comply with the voice and sight control regulations.

This program is only for dog guardians who intend to walk their dogs off-leash, under voice and sight control, where allowed on City of Boulder land. If you only walk your dog on a leash, you are not required to register. Program changes implemented in 2015 mean that previously issued green Voice and Sight Tags are no longer valid.

To minimize evacuation time, take the following steps to prepare your animals beforehand. Store an emergency kit and leashes as close to an exit as possible. Make sure all pets wear collars and tags with up-to-date identification. Your pet's ID tag should contain its name, telephone number, and any urgent medical needs. Be sure to write your pet's name, your name and contact information on your pet's carrier. Provide your pet with a more permanent form of identification, such as a microchip. A microchip is implanted in the animal's shoulder area, and can be read by scanners at most animal shelters. Always bring pets indoors at the first sign or warning of a storm or disaster. Pets can become disoriented and wander away from home during a crisis.

Fire Safety Education,Fire and Rescue,Fire ,Fire Safety Education,"Please call 303-441-4431 if you would like to schedule or get more information about any of the safety training we provide.   Senior safety: This program specifically targets the concerns of seniors by teaching fire safety, injury prevention and emergency preparedness. Firefighter educators meet regularly with residents of retirement and senior care facilities. This demographic tends to be independent and are often reluctant to call 911. Consequently, Fire-Rescure works hard to reassure residents that firefighters are available glad to respond whenever they are needed. Each year, Fire-Rescue also trains the staff of senior care facilities, reviews facility emergency procedures, and trains the employees to use fire extinguishers. Preschools and day cares: The preschool education focus is that ""Firefighters Are Our Friends."" This lesson is designed to ease fears and empower children to call 911 or call out to their rescuers (their ""friends"") to come get them (rather than hiding from the stranger in the mask.) Elementary schools: Firefighters teaching in the classroom have received a great deal of praise from teachers, families and administrators. Since 1998, Fire-Rescue has designed and implemented a progressive fire safety curriculum for kindergarten through third grades. Community events: Fire engines are common sights at Boulder community festivals and city-sponsored events. The firefighters use these opportunities to teach fire safety and raise awareness of their work. The goal is to teach the community how they can take charge of their own safety. Corporate training: Members of the Fire Safety Education Team train employees of local businesses in the proper use of fire extinguishers and emergency evacuation procedures. Fire station tours Station tours emphasize the ""Firefighters Are Our Friends"" theme by explaining the work and environment that is home to firefighters and their equipment. This relationship-building is an important aspect of neighborhood livability. A strong friendship with their local fire station and firefighters makes children less likely to play with fire. Educational tours are available for children five-years old and older. Neighborhood post-fire meetings: Neighborhood post-fire meetings are offered to a small segment of a neighborhood that has experienced a recent fire. These are held soon after a fire to take advantage of the neighbors' interest in what happened and how it can be avoided in the future. Typically, one of the neighbors hosts the meeting and invites others who are interested in attending. The firefighters or fire safety division personnel meet with neighbors to discuss fire safety in general. Association meetings: Homeowner and neighborhood association meetings are also perfect opportunities for residents and firefighters to discuss safety issues and concerns. Campus fire safety: Fire-Rescue has developed a specific curriculum for college students. Data shows that the university student population is at high risk to fire loss and injury. A fire safety partnership has been developed with the universities' cooperation and support. The shared goal is to reduce the risk of fire to the students (some living independently for the first time). Please note: Boulder Fire-Rescue does not host birthday parties. Educational fire station tours may be scheduled by parents or teachers for groups of children."

Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Fluoride,"Fluoride is a mineral that is naturally found in air, soil, water, plants and foods. Boulder's water sources contain small amounts of natural fluoride. The City of Boulder also adds fluoride to the drinking water to achieve a target level of 0.7 mg/L, which is based on 2015 federal and state guidance. The City of Boulder continues to pay close attention to scientific and regulatory developments and, as always, will comply with all regulatory changes."
Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Why is fluoride added to drinking water?,"The City of Boulder has added fluoride as part of the water treatment process since 1969, when Boulder voters approved a ballot measure to require the addition of fluoride to drinking water to reduce tooth decay. Any changes to the fluoridation ordinance would need to be approved by a community vote. All community members also have the opportunity to discuss fluoride at the City of Boulder's Water Resources Advisory Board meetings."
Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,What are the benefits of adding fluoride to drinking water?,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fluoridated water strengthens teeth and reduces tooth decay by approximately 25% in adults and children. Nearly all public health, dental, and medical organizations and agencies including the CDC, World Health Organization, American Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend community water fluoridation. The CDC considers drinking water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century."
Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,What is the city's process for adding fluoride?,"During water treatment, the city adds hydrofluorosilicic acid to increase the amount of fluoride in drinking water to a target level of 0.7 mg/L."
Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Is there a drinking water standard for fluoride?,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set an enforceable drinking water standard for fluoride, also referred to as a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) (i.e., the maximum amount allowed in water from public water systems). The fluoride MCL is 4.0 mg/L.  EPA also has a secondary, non-regulatory drinking water guideline of 2.0 mg/L set to protect children against cosmetic effects including tooth discoloration and tooth enamel pitting. The level of fluoride in Boulder’s drinking water is nearly six times lower than the MCL. Fluoridating drinking water is not required, but is a recommended public health measure. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA is prohibited from requiring public water systems to add any substances for preventative health care purposes."
Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Are there health risks associated with excess levels of fluoride in drinking water?,"According to EPA, exposure to excessive levels of fluoride over a lifetime may increase the likelihood of bone fractures in adults. Children under the age of nine, who are exposed to prolonged and elevated fluoride levels have an increased likelihood of dental cosmetic effects, such as pitting and discoloration. To protect public health from exposure to excessive levels of fluoride, EPA has established an MCL of 4.0 mg/L, which is nearly six times higher than the amount of fluoride in the city’s drinking water. For more information, see the Other Helpful Resources section, below."
Fluoride,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Can I use tap water with fluoride to mix infant formula?,"The CDC has published a community water fluoridation website providing information about preparing infant formula with fluoridated tap water. According to the CDC, infant formula may be prepared with fluoridated drinking water. If your baby exclusively drinks infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, the CDC notes that your baby may have an increased risk for mild dental fluorosis. To reduce this risk, the CDC recommends mixing the infant formula with low-fluoride bottled water some of the time. Typically, low-fluoride bottled water is labeled as de-ionized, purified, demineralized or distilled.

Frozen Water Pipes,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,How can I prevent and thaw frozen water pipes?,"Frozen water pipes can be avoided with a little planning and a few simple steps. When frigid arctic air hits, water freezes, and as it freezes, it expands -- causing pipes to burst and possibly flood. Pipes that freeze most frequently are those that are exposed to severe cold, such as outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, water sprinkler lines and water supply pipes in unheated interior areas such as basements and crawl spaces, attics, garages or kitchen cabinets. Pipes that run against exterior walls that have little or no insulation are also subject to freezing. Determine where the water shut-off valve is in the house and how to use it in case pipes freeze and break. Boulder's Fire Department recommends that every member of a household know this information and similar to a fire drill, practice turning the valve off and on. To determine where a water shut-off valve is, locate the outside water line that leads to the residence. The water line usually flows directly from the water meter to a location inside the residence. Likely places for the water turn-off valve include internal pipes running against exterior walls or where water service enters a home through the foundation. Before the onset of cold weather, prevent freezing of water supply lines: Drain water from swimming pool and water sprinkler supply lines following manufacturer's or installer's directions. Do not put antifreeze in these lines unless directed. Antifreeze is environmentally harmful and is dangerous to humans, pets, wildlife and landscaping. Remove, drain and carefully store hoses used outdoors. Close inside valves supplying outdoor hose bibs. Open the outside hose taps to allow water to drain. Keep the outside valve open so that any water remaining in the pipe can expand without causing the pipe to break. Check around the home for other areas where water supply lines are located in unheated areas. Look in the basement, crawl space, attic, garage, and under kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Both hot and cold water pipes in these areas should be insulated. A hot water supply line can freeze just as a cold water supply line can freeze if water is not running through the pipe, and the water temperature becomes cold. Consider installing specific products made to insulate water pipes like a ""pipe sleeve"" or installing UL-listed ""heat tape,"" ""heat cable,"" or similar materials on exposed water pipes. Many products are available at a building supplies retailer. Pipes should be carefully wrapped, with ends butted tightly and joints wrapped with tape. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for installing and using these products. Newspaper can provide some degree of insulation and protection to exposed pipes. During cold weather, take preventive action Keep garage doors closed if there are water supply lines in the garage. Open kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children. When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip (at a minimal amount) from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe, even at a trickle, helps prevent frozen pipes. During extreme cold, keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night. If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat set to a temperature no lower than 55oF. Thaw frozen pipes If your house or basement is flooding, turn off the water valve and call 911. If there is no flooding but you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, make sure your main water valve is turned on. If it is, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the suspected frozen area of the water pipe. As you treat the frozen pipe and the frozen area begins to melt, water will begin to flow through the frozen area. Running water through the pipe will help melt more ice in the pipe. Apply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, electric hair dryer, a portable space heater (kept away from flammable materials), or by wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove or other open flame device. Make sure a heating pad, hair dryer or other electrical devices do not come into contact with water. Keep the faucet open. Apply heat until full water pressure is restored. If you are unable to locate the frozen area, if the frozen area is not accessible or if you cannot thaw the pipe, call a licensed plumber. Check all other faucets in your home to find out if you have additional frozen pipes. If one pipe freezes, others may also freeze. Future Protection: Consider relocating exposed pipes to provide increased protection from freezing. For example, if the home is being remodeled, a professional can relocate pipes. To maintain higher temperatures, add insulation to attics, basements and crawl spaces. For more information about frozen pipes, contact a licensed plumber or building professional."

To pay online visit www.citepayusa.com. There is a drop box outside of the building for after-hours payments, or you may mail your payment."
General Court Questions,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What if I can't pay my fine by the court date or the due date? Can I get an extension?,"Fines and costs are due on the date that you either plead guilty or are found guilty after trial. In rare cases, the court will grant brief extensions of the payment due date. After the court has imposed your fine, you may complete an application for a stay of your payment obligation. Your application will be reviewed by the judge or the court's staff. The court charges a $25 stay fee."
General Court Questions,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What fines and costs should I expect to pay?,"Traffic infractions: The maximum penalty that may be imposed for a traffic infraction is a $500 fine, or $1,000 if the infraction occurred in a marked school or construction zone, plus $30 in court costs. Traffic offenses: These are the more serious traffic charges such as inattentive driving, reckless driving, no evidence of insurance, etc. The maximum penalty for a traffic offense is up to 90 days in jail, up to a $1,000 fine, plus $30 in court costs. The court may also order probation for up to two years. General offenses: These types of offenses include code and criminal violations. The maximum penalty that may be imposed for a general offense violation is 90 days in jail, a fine of up to $1,000, plus $30 in court costs. The court may also order probation for up to two years."
General Court Questions,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,How do I change or reset my court date?,"If your court date is currently set for your initial appearance, or arraignment, you may call the court at 303-441-1841 to speak with a clerk to assist you in changing the date. Cases are generally continued for one to two weeks, however, if circumstances warrant, a continuance of up to 30 days may be granted. If your case is set for any other type of court appearance, you must appear on your given court date unless you have previously submitted a written request to continue, which has been granted by the court."
General Court Questions,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,What if I miss my court date?,"If you miss your court date, a warrant may be issued for your arrest. In addition, a default judgment may be entered, meaning that the points for the charge may be assessed against your driving privilege. The fine will be automatically imposed and a hold may be placed on your driver's license. If a warrant has been issued, you may appear in court (call first to arrange a date and time), you may write a letter to the judge explaining why you missed your court date, or you can post a cash bond. You may be arrested at any time if a warrant has been issued, so it is advisable to exercise one of these options quickly. If a default judgment has been entered and more than thirty days have elapsed since the entry of the default, the court has no authority to set aside the default. In that situation, the fines and costs must be paid in full before the court will clear the hold on your license. If it has been less than 30 days since the entry of the default, the court has the authority to set aside the default, but will do so only in those rare cases where there has been a showing of good cause or excusable neglect."
General Court Questions,Municipal Court/Traffic Violations,Municipal Court ,How long will my court appearance take?,"Arraignment is your first court appearance, which can last up to three hours. Once everyone has assembled, the court clerk will give the group some information about court procedures. The judge will then take the bench and will advise all defendants of their rights. They will then begin calling up individual cases. If you wish to speak to the City Attorney, they will be available in the courtroom to speak to you about your case. Court trials can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, although the average is about 45 minutes. However, since several trials are scheduled at the same time, be prepared to wait for other trials to be completed before your trial begins. Jury trials are set for a full day, although the typical jury trial is often completed by mid-afternoon. Other court proceedings are brief and do not involve long wait times."

Hourly Billing Charges for Development Review Applications,"Building Permits and Inspections, Planning and Zoning",Public Works ,What can I do to minimize hourly billing costs?,"Here are some thoughts and strategies about how applicants can manage hourly billing costs: Submit a complete and accurate application. Missing or inaccurate information will result in revisions being required. More information is usually better than less. Make sure your written materials and plans clearly communicate what you are proposing. Get to know your project's neighbors and involve them in the process early. A little extra effort up front can save time and costs associated with public meetings later. Direct questions through a single point of contact on your design team so you don't pay the city to answer the same question twice. Your design team should review your proposal for conformance with city regulations including the Boulder Revised Code, 1981; Design and Construction Standards; and International Building Code before you submit an application. Clearly identify and justify any requested variances or unique design proposals. Items that do not meet city standards and are not identified as variance requests are likely to be identified as deficiencies and result in revisions being required. Many engineering submittals have the same deficiencies. Review the city's handout on engineering construction plans for tips on avoiding common mistakes."

Irrigation in City Parks,Parks Information,Parks and Recreation ,Irrigation in City Parks,"Irrigation Systems and Practices in City of Boulder Parks: Irrigation technology alone does not make for an efficient system, but if the system is designed correctly and well-maintained, it can lead to huge water savings. That is why the Parks and Recreation Department puts such an emphasis on efficient design and maintaining a robust maintenance program. With a dedicated, well-trained staff, irrigation technologies can be properly used to decrease water use. Parks and Recreation has certified landscape irrigation auditors who audit parks before and after upgrades. In some cases, staff have seen efficiency increases of up to 300 percent in parks that have been refurbished with new, improved irrigation system designs and advanced technology improvements. Parks and Recreation uses some of the same technology that is available to residential and commercial customers. In fact, many of these items are eligible for rebates like matched precipitation rotating heads, SMART irrigation controllers and drip systems. These use of these three items has resulted in significant decreases in Parks and Recreation's water use. Matched precipitation rotating heads are used in city parks as a replacement for standard (less efficient) spray heads. These heads have helped decrease water use and are the standard for watering any area of 35 feet or less. SMART irrigation controllers are used in all city parks. Parks and Recreation recently invested in a study to select the most practical controllers that would help save the greatest amount of water. As a result, Parks and Recreation is installing SMART irrigation controllers that have soil moisture sensors. This cutting-edge technology helps make sure that watering only occurs when it is necessary. Drip systems used in city parks are primarily subsurface. Even trees in newer parks are watered through subsurface drip. These systems can be more than 90 percent efficient with proper design, installation and maintenance. Parks and Recreation monitors these systems and makes sure they operate properly in order to save the greatest amount of water."

Living with Urban Wildlife,Animals,Police ,Living with Urban Wildlife,"Please contact the Animal Protection Unit at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint. The City of Boulder contains an abundant wildlife population. Nestled next to the foothills, we have the opportunity to see a wider variety of wildlife than many urban areas. Although these animals are wonderful to observe, they can also pose a conflict when they interact in close proximity. Prevention is the key. Do not feed wildlife. This is the number one attractant of unwanted wildlife. When you provide a food source, they begin to expect and depend on your generosity. Wild animals are capable of finding plenty of food on their own. It is illegal to feed wildlife within the Boulder city limits. Store all trash in sealed containers and keep it in the garage or a shed until the morning of the scheduled pick up day. Garbage is the primary attractant for all wildlife as it provides an easy food source. Do not feeds pets outside. Secure pet doors during evening and nighttime hours. Nocturnal wildlife, such as skunks and raccoons, may enter during the night. Cover window wells with commercially available grates or bubbles or make a cover yourself using one-inch hardware cloth or chicken wire. Close holes around and under the foundation of your home and outbuilding so that animals will not be tempted to burrow and create dens. Bury wire mesh one to two feet deep in places where animal might gain access. Screen fireplace chimneys, furnaces, attics, and dryer vents, and keep dampers closed. Chimneys make an ideal home for raccoons, birds or squirrels. Utilize chimney caps year-round and check the caps annually. Fence gardens and cover fruit trees with netting to protect your harvest. Scarecrows, hardware ground cloth and lights are other deterrents that can be effective in gardens. Check and repair any damaged, loose, or rotten boards that overhang your roof and make sure trees are cut back from your house.   Squirrels, bats, and birds may use this to access the house. Seal all cracks and holes around the foundation that are larger than a one-quarter inch in diameter to keep out rats, mice, bats and snakes. Deterrents: Any habitat-altering methods must be employed consistently for 7 to 14 days and monitored closely. Under the deck, shed or other potential den areasIf you are having problems with animals burrowing under a structure, it is most likely a skunk or a fox. In either case, the following methods can be implemented to deter the animals from living in and around your area. Place lit flashlights or lights with motion detectors at the entrance to the hole - the animals are looking for a dark place. If feasible, leave a radio on near the entrance to the hole with continual talk radio shows playing at high-volume. The audible sound of people talking can be a deterrent. Place ammonia-soaked rags in or around the ""den."" The liquid ammonia will evaporate and wash off in a rain storm. It is important that you check the rags daily and refresh the ammonia as needed. In the chimney: The inside of a chimney resembles a hollowed-out tree trunk, which is the perfect habitat for squirrels, raccoons and birds. Do not open the damper to look at or attempt to remove the animal if you hear it crawling in the chimney. This can cause additional issues if the animal becomes loose in your house. The animal may become frightened and can cause damage in their attempt to find an exit. It's best to leave the animals alone. In the majority of cases, the animals can climb out the chimney on their own, though they might need a little encouragement to do so. A bowl of ammonia placed in the base of the fireplace is an effective tool to discourage raccoons or squirrels from continuing their stay. The odor of the ammonia is unpleasant and will encourage the animals to move to a less-fragrant dwelling. If the ammonia is bothersome to you, close the doors to the fireplace or use an ammonia-soaked rag, which is less potent than the bowl of ammonia. Shine a light up the fireplace, which diminishes their peaceful habitat. If you apply these methods concurrently, the animals may leave faster. During the spring, animals may quickly nest to provide shelter for their babies. If an animal has already nested and has a family of babies in the chimney, don't panic - they will soon relocate the family to a less-disturbed area. Mothers are not inclined to abandon their young and they are able to move their young when necessary. Once you are sure the animal has left your residence, immediately secure a fitted chimney cap to the entrance of the chimney to prevent future problems. In the attic: Much like the chimney, the attic provides a safe, comfortable, undisturbed dwelling for animals such as raccoons and squirrels. The first step is to locate the point where the animals are entering. Check all soffits surrounding your home, and look for weaknesses or holes in the roof and the siding that surrounds your attic. Once the animal is effectively deterred from your home, repair the entrance point immediately. One-quarter-inch hardware cloth can be used to cover holes or entry points. Place ammonia-soaked rags in the attic to encourage the animals to relocate. Shine lights in the attic to encourage the animals to relocate. In the garden: Gardens are the number one attractant for all wildlife, including raccoons, skunks, bears, deer, squirrels and birds. Gardens provide a wonderful, readily-available food source for nearly every species of wildlife. Netting over fruit trees helps protect them from birds, squirrels, deer and other omnivores. Attach a water-sprayer with a motion detection feature to a hose in the garden. When the sensor detects movement, it sprays the area, scaring the wildlife away. Bird deterrents: Bird deterrents are altered to fit the unique ability that birds have to avoid the usual mammal deterrents. Although birds can provide the same type of nuisance within a house or garden that mammals do, they are not as affected by ammonia, moth balls, or consistent noise from a radio. Models of owls, hawks and snakes scare away pigeons temporarily. They must resemble their living counterpart and must be positioned in a manner that is natural for the actual predator. It is helpful to relocate them frequently. Mylar tape/streamers, old CDs, balls of aluminum foil, or aluminum soda cans secured to trees, the side of the house, or roosting site reflects light that annoys birds. Balloons filled with helium that have an ""eye spot"" (black dot) painted on one side (to emphasize movement) can be tied near the roost side. Children's pinwheels may also deter birds. Noise-making, with firecrackers, wind chimes, or a can of rocks is effective, as long as the noise is loud and sudden. Noise repellents must be used frequently to be effective.

Mosquitoes,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Mosquitoes,"Please submit questions, complaints or concerns about mosquito activity and/or report areas of stagnant water on city-owned properties. Feel free to contact us to ask questions about mosquito management in general or to share ideas or feedback. You may find some of your questions answered in the information below: West Nile Virus Since 2003, the City of Boulder has had a Mosquito Control Program designed specifically to target the mosquitoes that can potentially transmit West Nile Virus (WNv) to humans. Boulder County Public Health also conducts a mosquito control program in areas outside of city limits and works closely with all cities in Boulder County to manage mosquitoes and educate the public about taking steps to reduce the risk of WNv transmission to humans. The City of Boulder uses a number of approaches to reduce the risk of WNV. Adult mosquitoes are trapped and tested for WNv and the estimated risk to people is calculated each week. Mosquito breeding sites are mapped on all city property and the mosquitoes that can carry WNv are treated with an effective larvicide when they are found. In addition: OSMP agricultural staff inspect ditches, maintain irrigation systems and work with agricultural lessees to manage irrigation water release to decrease standing water; Public Works staff respond to complaints about standing water, inspect, work with ditch companies and property owners to restore water flow, and improve infrastructure of storm water management systems; Grazing, mowing, controlled burns and vegetative restoration are used to decrease adult mosquito harborage sites; OSMP trails staff have been filling potholes on South Boulder Creek trails and have identified the area for a more significant capital project to restore the sub-grade and prevent future potholing; OSMP is undertaking a trail/irrigation drainage study to reduce unnecessary standing water on city open space; City ecology staff manage city properties to protect biodiversity to sustain populations of mosquito predators that naturally control large numbers of mosquitoes; and City wetland ecologists actively manage the city’s wetlands to enhance ecosystem function and create healthy wetland communities that naturally reduce mosquito activity.    Since these mosquitoes readily breed in standing water on private property, it's crucial that all Boulder and county residents do their part to reduce the risk to the community by regularly inspecting their properties and removing any standing water. The most important way to reduce your risk of getting WNV is to take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites. Please visit the Mosquito Control Program webpage for more information, including a video and West Nile Virus Fact Sheet with tips to mosquito-proof your property and protect yourself from mosquito bites. Nuisance mosquitoes: The City of Boulder treats limited sites to reduce the number of nuisance mosquitoes around several popular recreational areas, and the Greenbelt Meadows and San Lazaro neighborhoods. Sombrero Marsh, Burke II and the Kentucky Property, and wetland areas within Flatirons Golf Course, Boulder Reservoir, Stazio Ball Fields, East Boulder Community Park, Pleasantview Soccer Fields, Valmont City Park, and Christensen Park are included in this program. The Parks and Recreation Department employs other controls, including mosquito magnets and mowing at Stazio Ball Fields and Flatirons Golf Course, to further improve player comfort at these sites. Boulder County residents If you live outside the City of Boulder, visit the Boulder County Mosquito Control website for more information. To report mosquito activity in neighborhoods outside the Boulder City Limits, contact Boulder County's hotline at 303-273-2878 or toll free at 877.276.4306."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Mountain Lions,Colorado Parks and Wildlife has provided this list of Frequently Asked Questions in response to questions about mountain lion management in the City of Boulder.   Colorado Parks and Wildlife is responsible for the direct management of all wildlife in the state.
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why are there lions in Boulder?,"Wildlife requires, and will seek out, adequate habitat in order to survive.   The land surrounding Boulder including Open Space and Mountain Parks, US Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties and the private land in mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for lions.   Habitat can be described as four basic needs: food, shelter, water, and space.   Lions come into and use the City of Boulder from the surrounding areas because within the city limits all four of these needs ca be met.   Food is found in the form of deer, small mammals, livestock, and pets.   Shelter includes not only the heavy vegetation throughout the city in yards and along irrigation ditches, but also human-made shelter such as the spaces underneath decks.   There is an abundance of water, in ponds, ditches, and in backyard water features (fountains and backyard ponds).   Finally, space is available in backyards, parks, and in the ditches and creeks, which serve as ideal movement corridors for lions and other wildlife.   There are lions in Boulder because there is quality habitat in Boulder, and lions do not recognize city limits when seeking a living."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What do lions eat?,"Lions are opportunistic, predatory carnivores and will prey on a variety of large and small mammals, both wild and domestic.   In Colorado, lions most often prey on deer, but they will also kill and feed on other large mammals such as elk and bighorn sheep.   If left unprotected, domestic livestock such as llamas, ponies, goats, sheep and chickens can become food for lions.   Lions will also feed on a variety of small mammals such as raccoons, foxes, coyotes, squirrels, and domestic pets.   To minimize conflicts between domestic animals and lions, livestock should be kept in secure, fully enclosed structures, especially near dawn, dusk, and throughout the nighttime hours.   When allowed outdoors, pets should be closely supervised or kept in secure enclosures (with a roof) at all times."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What is a cache and what does it look like?,"A cache is the carcass of something that a lion has killed.   Lions sometimes drag their kill a short distance to a place they feel is protected before they start to feed on it.   When a lion is finished feeding, it will partially cover, or “cache” the kill by scraping the ground substrate (eg. pine needles, twigs, leaves or dirt) over the carcass.   The lion may leave the area until the next feeding, or may guard the cache and stay very close to it.   Depending on the size of the kill, the lion may return periodically for several days to feed on the carcass.   If you see a carcass that looks like it may have been cached, stay away from the carcass and call the Boulder Police non-emergency number at 303-441-3333 (anytime) or Colorado Parks and Wildlife at 303-291-7227 (business hours – 8:00 – 5:00)."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why can’t Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) take all of lions out of town and keep them out?,"There is no feasible way to keep lions out of the City of Boulder and due to the often unpredictable nature of wildlife, there are not always opportunities to remove each lion from the city before that lion leaves on its own.    When appropriate, CPW officers will attempt to capture lions either by tranquillizing them with a dart gun, by using a baited trap, or using other techniques.   Officers may also attempt to haze lions out of the city using tools such as rubber buckshot.   Hazing, capture and/or relocation may not be appropriate, practical, or successful in every situation.   When a mountain lion is relocated two outcomes are possible: either the relocated lion returns to its former range, or a different lion moves into the vacated territory which may include a portion of the City of Boulder.    Additionally, lions can jump over very high fences and there are no proven techniques to exclude mountain lions from large areas like the City of Boulder."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What does Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) do about lions in town?,"The CPW follows a statewide directive when responding to mountain lions in the City of Boulder.   Each situation is dynamic and unique as to what actions are appropriate, safe and effective when dealing with a particular lion in a particular location.   In addition, CPW does not have the opportunity to take action on every lion that comes into town as lions often return on their own to the foothills west of the City.   Given the fact that situations involving wildlife are never the same and outcomes are rarely predictable there are no cut and dried answers for dealing with lions in town, but generally speaking the following are true:  if a lion sighting is reported in the City of Boulder an officer will respond and attempt to locate the lion.   This could be a CPW officer, a City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks ranger, an animal control officer, or a police officer. While responding to the initial call and during the follow up CPW officers and City of Boulder officers work together to provide the most timely and appropriate level of response necessary.   Public safety is always the primary consideration in determining the appropriate response on lions in Boulder.      If a lion is located a CPW officer will respond and, depending on each individual situation, may attempt to haze the lion out of town or tranquilize the lion using a tranquilizer dart gun.   If a lion kills a deer or other wildlife in a yard in the city and “caches” it, a wildlife officer, only with permission from the homeowner, may set a trap and attempt to trap and relocate the lion.   CPW will kill lions that are aggressive towards people, or lions that are determined to be dangerous.   Additionally, the CPW makes every reasonable attempt to notify and educate neighbors and neighborhoods about lions in town by posting signs, knocking on doors, and providing information on neighborhood websites.   CPW and the City of Boulder are always working together to develop the most efficient avenues of notification and continue to try to improve communication about lions and lion activity. Boulder residents and visitors should be aware that a lion may be encountered at any time and should always take appropriate precautions to minimize conflicts with lions."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Is Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) waiting until someone is injured or killed before doing something about the lions?,"CPW and City of Boulder officers that work in and around Boulder are committed to doing whatever they can to protect people and pets from mountain lions.    They currently do so not only by educating and informing residents of Boulder but also by hazing, tranquilizing, trapping, and relocating lions when appropriate and feasible, and killing individual lions when necessary.   Unfortunately, CPW cannot exclude lions from the city and cannot completely eliminate all risk to people and pets from mountain lions. Therefore, to minimize the risk of lion conflicts it is essential that residents and visitors to Boulder be vigilant and responsive to lion activity in their community.   CPW continues to encourage the thoughtful discussion between neighbors, CPW, and the City of Boulder on what can be done to discourage the presence of lions in the city and what measures people can take knowing that lions may be present at any time."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What are the risks to humans from lions?,"In Colorado, there have been 2 confirmed deaths and 1 suspected death caused by mountain lions.   All three have occurred since 1990, and all of these incidents occurred in undeveloped areas away from towns.   In Boulder, the natural areas surrounding the city experience high visitation (an estimated 4.7 million visits to city Open Space and Mountain Parks (OSMP) property during a 12-month period in 2004 and 2005[1]) and there has been one reported attack on OSMP property which occurred in 2006.   Four additional people were injured by mountain lions in Boulder County between 1990 and 2000, all of which also occurred outside the Boulder city limits.   Across the wider range of mountain lions in the western United States and Canada, attacks on humans are also very rare.    There has been an average of 0.2 annual human deaths in all of North America from mountain lions between 1900 and 2007.   This number is very low compared to annual deaths from black widow spiders (1.4 between 1950-1989), domestic dogs (16 between 1979-1998) and car crashes (45,000 between 1980-2005).    While the risk of a lion attack is very low, there is still a risk associated with living or recreating in lion habitat.   The obvious facts to take into account are that lions are predators, they prey on large mammals, and throughout their range they have on very rare occasions been responsible for some human injuries and deaths.   It is up to individuals to balance these facts and decide it means to them, how they fit into an individual’s daily risk management, and what steps they are willing to take to mitigate those risks."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What can I do to keep myself/my kids safe? Can my kids play outside and walk to school unsupervised?,"The most important thing you can do to reduce the risk to you and your family is to be aware that mountain lions are, at times, present in the City of Boulder.   The next step is to educate yourself and everyone in your house about mountain lions.   A great place to start is on the CPW website: http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/LivingwithWildlifeLion1.aspx     Colorado Parks and Wildlife recommends that children be supervised when outside in lion, bear and coyote habitat.   The risk of injury or death to humans from lions, including children, is very low, however there is a minimal level of risk that cannot be completely eliminated in Boulder.    Some parents feel most comfortable when their children are directly supervised by an adult at all times.   Depending on the child’s age and maturity, others feel comfortable educating their children on what to do if they see a lion and allow their children to walk to school or play outside with a group of friends.   Some parents give their child a whistle or air horn to signal a problem or concern (wildlife or otherwise) if they are playing outside without an adult immediately present.   Teach your children to be aware of wildlife and what to do if they encounter wildlife.   Practicing scenarios ahead of time can better prepare children for an unexpected encounter with various wildlife species, including mountain lions.    Adults may decide to do more or less than what is recommended.   There are many decisions we make every day to minimize a variety of risks to our children, our pets, and ourselves.   In Boulder, there is the extra necessity of considering the risks from wildlife when making those decisions. Each individual, pet owner, and parent must evaluate the risk for themselves and make the decisions they find to be most appropriate."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What can I do to keep my pets safe?,"There are actions you can take to reduce the risk to your pets from mountain lions.   First, it is important to note that lions routinely kill deer and other large mammals for food and have killed dogs as large as a Great Pyrenees. Therefore, don’t assume because you have a large dog that it is safe.   Colorado Parks and Wildlife recommends that you always supervise your pets when they are outside.   Most pets are attacked near dusk, during the night, and near dawn.   Therefore, if your dog needs to go outside during these hours put it on a leash and go with it — carry a flash light, talk in a loud voice, and carefully look around your backyard before you go out.   If you must leave your pet unattended outside, build a fully enclosed kennel (including a roof or sturdy fencing on top).   Finally, keep your cat indoors.   Cats face risks not only from mountain lions but also foxes, owls, and coyotes.   Keeping them indoors is the only way to keep house cats safe."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How can I discourage lions coming onto or near my property?,"If you remove what is considered to be habitat from your property you will reduce the incentive for a lion to come onto your property.   This habitat can be described as four basic needs.    The first is food.   Mule deer make up a large proportion of a lion’s diet.   By planting vegetation that deer do not like to eat or by using landscaping products meant to exclude deer you can remove a primary attractant.   That said, lions will also eat raccoons and small mammals.   By securing your garbage properly and blocking off access to places animals might choose to den, you will also exclude species that make up the rest of a lion’s diet.   Additionally, do not feed wildlife.   Feeding deer and fox not only has the potential to attract mountain lions to your yard but is illegal in the City of Boulder.     Next is water. Water features in a backyard are huge attractants for a variety of wildlife including lions.   If you don’t want lions in your backyard then you should not have water features.     The last two needs for habitat are shelter and space.   To limit these you should eliminate any places in your yard that serve as good hiding places.   Lions are ambush predators and stalk prey from cover. Low lying, large bushes and shrubs, spaces under decks, or any place that wildlife can rest comfortably without being seen should be removed or blocked off.   Installing outside lighting can help you see a lion if it is on your property, and may make it less inviting."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Are there more lions in town now than in the past?,"Some long-time residents believe so... Unfortunately, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) does not have data to definitively answer this question.   Some long-time residents of Boulder have expressed that they had rarely heard of or seen a mountain lion in the city until the recent past.   Others say that they have always known that lions come into the city from time to time.   Because so many factors affect the behavior and movement of wildlife and people’s perception of it, it is very difficult to do any more than speculate as to why reported, perceived, or actual lion activity in Boulder has increased.   Lion sightings and/or pet attacks in the City of Boulder can occur sporadically, or in clusters.    Several months may pass without a single report of a lion in the City, or several reports may be received in a single week.    The clusters of activity may be caused by one lion, or by different lions."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Will I encounter lions east of Broadway?,"Lions occasionally travel east of Broadway, though sightings on the west side of Boulder near the foothills are much more common.   In recent years lions have been confirmed in areas such as Gunbarrel, Lafayette, Longmont, Firestone, Aurora, eastern Colorado and some Midwestern states.   Anyone residing in or visiting the City of Boulder should be aware that they may encounter a lion at any time and in any neighborhood.   See lion activity map for confirmed lion sightings and activity in the city between March and July 2009."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Are the lions that are moving and hunting near homes and people in the city becoming so habituated to people that they pose an elevated risk? If a lion is brazen enough to kill a pet in a backyard isn’t its next logical prey a human?,"Numbers have shown that throughout their range lions choose to prey on deer and other four legged animals and despite ample opportunity, not on humans.   For us, it is more logical to think of our pets as a member of our human family, but to a lion your dog shares much more in common with a normal prey item such as a raccoon.    The Cougar Management Guidelines Working Group stated in 2005 that there was no scientific evidence to indicate that cougar habituation to humans affects the risk of attack.   So while mountain lions may be more visible in the City and pets are certainly at an elevated risk there is nothing to suggest that this habituation increases the existing risk to people from mountain lions."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,When are lions most active? Is it unusual to see a lion in the middle of the day?,"Lions are most active near dusk, dawn, and anytime throughout the night.   This is when they are typically moving and hunting for prey and this is when the majority of sightings, encounters and conflicts, such pet attacks, occur.   Lions can be active at any time of day or night, however, and it is not unusual or abnormal for lions to be spotted moving or hunting during daylight hours."
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What does it mean if a lion has eartags and/or a collar? Are you tracking lions?,"Eartags are placed on wildlife that have been previously captured for any reason.   Lions are typically moved due to being in an inappropriate location (such as within the City limits of Boulder), because they were orphaned and needed to be rehabilitated before release, or because of nuisance behavior.   The eartag colors depend on the circumstance of capture, but typically in the northeast region of the state, lions will have green eartags.     Colorado Parks and Wildlife conducted a Front Range Mountain Lion Research Study between 2008 and 2015.   Lions that were captured and put into the study will have eartags, as well as a collar with GPS capabilities.   Some goals of the study included finding ways to get better lion population estimates, getting a better understanding of how lions utilize habitat to move between urban fringe areas and more rural, open lands within their home ranges, and finding ways to minimize human-lion conflicts.   More information on the study can be found at: http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/ResearchMammalsRP-12.aspx"
Mountain Lions,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,"If Colorado Parks and Wildlife wants to capture a lion, what methods are used?","Whether or not capture efforts are initiated, and what methods might be used, depends on the location and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the activity.   Many times when a sighting is reported the lion typically leaves the area on its own without incident and is therefore unable to be located.   If a lion has a cache that can be located, a live box trap may be set using the cache as bait, since the lion will likely return to feed on the cache at some point.   If a lion is free-roaming in the City of Boulder, we may attempt to tranquilize it if we can locate it and get close enough to effectively shoot it with a dart.   Hounds may be used in limited situations if there is an injury to a human from a lion.   When hounds are used they are carefully controlled to minimize risk of injury to the lion or hounds."

Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,I received a ticket for an expired plate but actually have registered my vehicle. What should I do?,"If your vehicle was registered prior to the date upon which you received the ticket, the court may waive one citation with proof of registration. If your vehicle was not registered at the time that the citation was issued, but you have subsequently registered the vehicle, the court will reduce the fine by 50 percent (for one citation) with proof of registration. To request a waiver or fine reduction, fill out a written appeal and attach the registration documentation to your appeal. You are obligated to display current registration on your license plate at all times. Simply having the registration is not good enough. If you have not already done so, place the new year and month decals on the license plate. In the future, please be mindful of the expiration of the license plates, re-register the plates, and place the decals on the plate in a timely manner and in the correct fashion. The court will not waive citations for repeat violations, even if the registration is current."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why did I receive a citation for failing to have a front plate?,"Under Colorado law, if your vehicle is registered in Colorado, you are required to display front and rear plates on your vehicle. The license plate cannot be placed in the windshield. See Colorado Revised Statute Section 42-3-202."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why did I get a ticket for parking in front of my own driveway or alley?,"It is unlawful to park within 5 feet of a driveway or alley, even if it is in front of your own property. This ordinance is designed to promote safety. A vehicle parked within 5 feet of an alley or driveway may block the view of vehicles entering and exiting the driveway or alley, creating a safety hazard."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why can't I park on the sidewalk?,"Part of a vehicle may be parked on the sidewalk, as long as pedestrians and wheelchair users should not have to go around any portion of a vehicle."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why can't I park a few minutes at a time throughout the day in a residential zone?,"The city does not have the technology to keep track of how long a vehicle is parked in a residential zone. If a vehicle parks in a residential zone and then leaves, it will be deemed to have used up its allotted time for parking in that zone and may not return later that day."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why was I issued a ticket for parking a vehicle in my own yard or on my property?,"The city has adopted various rules governing the use of land. Some of these rules prohibit parking in a yard or on private property. See Boulder Revised Code (BRC) 1981 Section 9-9-1, et.seq. Before parking vehicles on your property, you should contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at 303-441-1880. The fact that others park on their property without receiving a citation does not mean that you may park vehicles in your yard or on other parts of your property. I received a citation for parking where permit required, but moved my vehicle to another space within the time limit."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why did I receive a ticket?,"The signs posted in permit areas state that you can only park once per day in a certain color zone. This means that you cannot return to any part of the zone, even if you were not there for the full amount of time authorized. These zones can consist of many blocks. The purpose of this rule is to allow everyone a specific amount of time for parking, after which they must move out of the zone completely, allowing someone else the same opportunity."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,How do I obtain a parking permit for my neighborhood?,"For information on the Neighborhood Parking Program, please contact Parking Services at 303-413-7300."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,I received a notice from the city about a ticket that I never received. The ticket must have blown off my windshield or the violation occurred when someone else was driving the vehicle. Do I still have to pay?,"The parking violation goes with the vehicle. If the ticket is not paid, your vehicle may be placed on the ""scofflaw list,"" which could result in your vehicle being booted or towed. In rare circumstances, the judge will consider waiving late fees (not fines), but only upon determining that the defendant did not actually receive a copy of the parking ticket. The court cannot waive scofflaw fees."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,"How does a vehicle end up on the ""pick-up"" or ""scofflaw"" list? How do I get my vehicle off of this list? Can I get a payment plan? Will I stay on the list if I set up a payment plan?","BRC Section 2-6-7 provides that a vehicle will be placed on the ""scofflaw"" or ""pick-up"" list when the vehicle has a ticket that has remained unpaid for ten days after the court has mailed a letter to the owner, indicating that the overdue fine has not been paid. You may work out a payment plan, but your vehicle will remain on the scofflaw list until the amount owed has been paid in full."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,What information do I need to provide when I am disputing a handicapped-only parking violation?,"If you have a handicapped placard, the court may waive your fine. To request a waiver, fill out a written appeal and attach a copy of the placard to your appeal."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,"The handicapped parking space that I am charged with parking in was not well marked, or the markings were covered with snow/ice. How does this affect my case?","If you do not believe that the parking space was adequately marked as a handicapped space, you may appeal the citation or set the case for trial where a judge will decide if the space was adequately marked. The city must prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the violation of the ordinance occurred. You can be found guilty at trial only if the judge is convinced that the parking space was marked so that a reasonably observant person would have known that they were parking in a handicapped space. The question of whether you were put on notice that the space was a handicapped parking space will be decided by the judge at your trial."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Do I have to pay to park even if I have a handicapped placard or plate?,"Yes. In Boulder, handicapped spaces are liberally provided in close proximity to restaurants and shops throughout the city's pay to park zones. However, you must still pay to park in these areas in the same way that others must pay to park. Meter and Pay Station Ticket I received a ticket for failing to display a pay station receipt."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,"I have a copy of the receipt, which was valid when I was cited for the violation. What should I do?","The court may waive the citation with proof that you purchased a pay station receipt. To request this waiver, fill out a written appeal and attach a copy of the pay station receipt. The law states that you must display a current, valid receipt to park in a pay to park zone. The court will not waive future violations for failing to display this receipt, even if you provide a copy of a valid receipt."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Why did I receive a ticket when I was only parked at this location for a few minutes?,The amount of time that a vehicle is parked in violation of a city ordinance is not relevant to the question of whether a violation has occurred. There is no rule that allows a vehicle to be parked in violation of a city ordinance for only a few minutes.
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,"If there is a five-minute grace period to buy a receipt, why was I issued a ticket within five minutes of parking?","The five-minute grace period applies after the pay station receipt expires. Before issuing a citation, a parking officer will check the nearby pay stations to make sure that the vehicle owner is not in the process of purchasing a pay station receipt and will not issue a ticket in such circumstance."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,"If there is still time left on my kiosk receipt, can I park in another area?",Yes. Any unexpired time remaining on a pay station receipt may be used at any pay to park zone in the city.

Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Don't motorcycles get to park for free?,"There are certain designated areas near the Pearl Street Mall where motorcycles and scooters may park for free. However, if a motorcycle is parked in a pay-to-park zone, a pay station receipt must be purchased and affixed to the motorcycle. Motorcycles are not permitted to park on sidewalks or at bike racks."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Are scooters allowed to park for free in bike racks?,"No. It is true that under state law, a scooter is not considered a ""motor vehicle"" for purposes of traffic laws. However, for parking matters in the City of Boulder, a scooter is considered a ""vehicle."" Therefore, owners of scooters must comply with all motor vehicle parking laws. A scooter is not permitted to park on the sidewalk.   Appeal a Parking Ticket Learn how to Appeal a Parking Ticket in the City of Boulder."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,"I tried to purchase a receipt from a pay station, but it was not working properly. Why should I have to pay a fine?","You can purchase a receipt from any Boulder Parking pay station. If the pay station at which you attempt to purchase a receipt is not working, you should purchase a receipt from another pay station. If you have not previously had a pay station violation waived, the court may consider waiving your citation as a courtesy. For parking tickets received as the result of a broken meter or pay station, please call the Violations Bureau at 303-441-4212 in order to start the process for a meter check. Report a Broken Parking Meter or Pay Station online or call 303-413-7300."
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Parking Tickets in Boulder Municipal Court: Can the judge reduce my fine or dismiss my ticket if I speak to them?,The judge can not reduce your fine or dismiss your parking ticket unless the prosecutor fails to prove the parking violation at trial. The amount of your fine is mandatory and is set by city ordinance.
Parking Tickets,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,Under what circumstances will court costs be assessed? How much are they? Are they assessed for each parking ticket?,"The court imposes $25 in court costs when a defendant decides to appear before the judge to discuss his/her case. This fee will be charged for each ticket, but only once per case (if a case goes to trial, the court does not impose costs each time the defendant is in court on the case). If the defendant pays the fine without seeing the judge, court costs are not assessed."

I received a notice from the city about a ticket that I never received."
Pay a Parking Ticket,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,How can I be held responsible for a ticket that I did not receive?,"The Boulder Revised Code places responsibility for parking infractions on the registered owner of the vehicle. It is possible that the ticket described in the notice was blown off of the windshield, removed by another person, or received by another driver of your vehicle.

Pay a Parking Ticket,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,What can I do?,"If you were not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time that the tickets were issued, you should file a written appeal and provide copies of any documents showing the transfer of ownership (such as a bill of sale or other formal title transfer documentation). The court will review the documentation provided and, when appropriate, amend its files to identify the correct vehicle owner. You should also contact the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Office to make sure that the plates issued in your name and previously attached to the vehicle have been cancelled. This will prevent you from being sent further parking notices for the vehicle and will also prevent you from being issued photo radar tickets received by the current owner of the vehicle."
Pay a Parking Ticket,Parking Services,Municipal Court ,What happens if I don't pay a parking ticket?,"If you do not pay or otherwise respond to your ticket within 14 calendar days from the date of the violation, the fine will increase by $15.

Additionally, Boulder Revised Code (BRC) 1981 Section 2-6-7 authorizes the court to place vehicles with one or more overdue parking tickets on the scofflaw list (also known as the ""pick-up"" list). Notice that the ticketed vehicle has been placed on the scofflaw list may be mailed to the registered owner of the vehicle at the address listed on the registration. If you do not respond to this notice by the date indicated in the notice, you give up your right to contest the overdue parking ticket(s). Once a vehicle is on the scofflaw or ""pick-up"" list, the vehicle may be towed and impounded.

Pet Safety Tips,Animals,Police ,Pet Safety Tips,"If you are concerned about unsupervised animals left in hot or cold cars, call Boulder Police Dispatch at 303-441-3333. Hot Weather Tips Hot cars are deadly! It only takes minutes! On warm days, the inside of a car heats up quickly. When it's 85 degrees out, the temperature inside of a car can heat up to 102 degrees in 10 minutes and can reach 120 degrees in half an hour. What to know: Animals can only withstand excessive temperatures for short time before suffering irreparable brain damage - or even death. Look for signs of heat exhaustion, like excessive panting and lethargy. If an animal is overheated: immediately cover the animal with a cool, wet towel until its body temperature lowers; keep the animal's feet cool and moist; give the animal small amounts of water to drink; and consult with a veterinarian immediately to determine if additional treatment is needed. Cold Weather Tips  Provide adequate shelter Even if your pets are indoor/outdoor creatures, make sure their outdoor areas are well-sheltered from the cold and wind. Dog houses should face south and be filled with hay or straw as blankets freeze and do not help keep animals warm. The shelter entryway should be protected by a self-closing door, an offset door, or a flexible flap made of windproof material. This will allow the animal to maintain its body heat in frigid temperatures. Keep animals inside during especially cold spells and inclement weather. Supply plenty of potable water Make sure your pets have plenty of food and water. Winter air can be very dry, leaving pets dehydrated. If your pet's water bowl is kept outside, make sure the water hasn't frozen during a cold snap. Use caution when leaving your pet's food outside, as wild animals may be drawn to it. Monitor outdoor activity When taking pets outside for exercise or play, keep them warm with a sweater or jacket, and only allow them to play for short periods of time. Pets can become cold quickly as they lose body heat from the large portions of their body that are exposed to the weather, such as their feet and face. If your pet is playing off-leash in a snowy area, keep them in sight at all times. Snow makes it difficult for dogs to scent their way back to you and they may become lost or confused. Be careful with dangerous chemicals and ice-melt products While taking steps to prepare your car for the long winter, be on the lookout for any antifreeze or engine coolant spills that might occur. These products contain chemicals that are harmful and potentially fatal to animals. It is important that you remember to store any potentially harmful chemicals in clearly marked sealed containers stored in a location that is inaccessible to your pets. Ice-melt products may contain ingredients such as calcium chloride and sodium chloride (table salt) that can irritate animal paws or skin. Pets may also accidentally ingest ice melt from their paws or from the ground. Depending on the amount ingested, ice melts can potentially produce a variety of effects such as drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, and, in severe cases, cardiac abnormalities, seizures, and even death. If you suspect your pet may have accidentally ingested any harmful ingredients, please seek veterinary treatment immediately. Check your vehicle During the winter, cats sometimes sleep under the hoods of cars for warmth and protection. A car's fan belt can kill or injure an animal when the motor starts. If you are aware that there are outdoor or feral cats in your neighborhood, please bang on the hood of the car and wait a few seconds before turning on the engine."

Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Prairie Dogs,"Prairie dogs live in and around Boulder, on open space and on private property."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How does the city protect prairie dogs and their habitat?,"The city owns and manages more 45,000 acres of land outside the city dedicated to open space. For information on how prairie dogs are managed on Open Space and Mountain Parks properties visit https://bouldercolorado.gov/osmp/grassland-ecosystem-management-plan In addition, the City of Boulder's Urban Wildlife Plan Prairie Dog Component identifies urban colonies for near-term and long-term protection."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What organization manages prairie dogs and other wildlife?,"Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) controls many aspects of prairie dog management, such as relocation, rehabilitation and hunting. The management of prairie dog habitat, however, is the responsibility of the landowners where prairie dogs live. Boulder has chosen to develop regulations and policies to guide the management of prairie dogs in the city and on city-owned lands."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why can't prairie dogs that pose conflicts with parks and other land uses be relocated to another site?,"The city evaluates relocation opportunities on an annual basis, and effects relocations as feasible. Unfortunately, there are not enough relocation sites for all the prairie dogs that are in conflict with other land uses."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why can't prairie dogs be relocated elsewhere in Colorado?,"In 1999, state legislature passed a law that prohibits the release of prairie dogs in another county without permission of the county commissioners of both the sending and receiving sites. Since prairie dogs are considered ""pests"" by the state, county commissions are generally not receptive to the release of prairie dogs."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why can't the city buy more land for the prairie dogs?,"Since the focus of the Open Space and Mountain Parks department is ecosystem management and balancing broad open space values, the department has not and is not likely to purchase lands solely for prairie dogs."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What is the status of the black-tailed prairie dog as a species?,"The black-tailed prairie dog receives no protection under the federal Endangered Species Act. In Colorado, the Colorado Natural Heritage Program lists the black-tailed prairie dog as vulnerable to extirpation. CPW identifies the black-tailed prairie dog as abundant according to their grassland management plan thresholds, and as a species of special concern."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why are active prairie dog colonies important to protect?,"Prairie dogs create local conditions with a diversity of plants, animals and soils that are distinct from the surrounding prairie. When the landscape does not suit them, they change it to make the land safer and more comfortable in their homes. The ecological health and diversity of grasslands depends upon a patchwork of prairie dog colonies, grasslands, wetlands, riparian (creek-side) areas, and other features, creating many habitats. The prairie dog-modified landscape attracts a distinct group of animals, including burrowing owls, hawks, and eagles."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,"Who has ultimate responsibility for keeping prairie dogs off private land where they are not wanted, especially if they are coming from public land?","The state government has management responsibility for wildlife in Colorado. In the City of Boulder, individual landowners may choose to allow prairie dogs to inhabit their property or to control prairie dogs in accordance with state and local regulations. The City of Boulder's Open Space and Mountain Parks Department has a policy of working with neighbors and property owners to help identify and evaluate actions that the landowner can take if they prefer to maintain their properties without prairie dogs."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How concerned do I need to be about getting the plague from prairie dogs? How can I protect myself and my family from it?,"Plague is transmitted by fleas, not by prairie dogs, so the best strategy is to avoid getting bitten by fleas. Don't venture into prairie dog colonies or approach their burrows. Never get close to or touch a wild rodent (squirrel, chipmunk, prairie dog, etc.). Don't approach or handle dead rodents. Never feed wildlife. When animals come up to you, they could transmit an infected flea. Dogs and cats can pick up fleas from prairie dog colonies and may carry the fleas into your neighborhood or home. Keep your pets away from prairie dog colonies or any dead rodent. Your pet could pick up an infected flea and transmit it to you. It's illegal for dogs to chase or harass wildlife in Boulder and allowing your dog to do so could result in a fine."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What has happened to the prairie dog population and its historical range?,"During the past 100 years, much of the historic range of the black-tailed prairie dog has been converted to food production for humans, mostly for cattle pasture and grain fields. Expanding urban areas, especially the rapidly growing Front Range in Colorado, have seen housing and commercial development replace grasslands. Out of an estimated 100 million acres of former black-tailed prairie dog colonies, about 2 percent remains. Around the turn of the century, the U.S. government sponsored prairie dog poisoning programs to reduce competition with livestock and farmers. This program, which continues today, peaked in Colorado in 1921, when approximately 80,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were poisoned."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,Why is there competition with development or livestock?,"Prairie dogs compete with livestock for food, clipping vegetation to maintain a view of their surroundings and eating the same grasses that would otherwise be available for cattle and horses. On farmlands, prairie dogs can decimate or destroy a crop of alfalfa, grains or hay."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,How are prairie dog burrows laid out and maintained?,"Prairie dogs excavate elaborate systems of burrows in heavily grazed, flat prairie lands and create colonies comprised of thousands of prairie dogs. The burrows are easily identified because of the large mound of dirt surrounding the entrance, providing a vantage point to spot approaching predators, as well as flood protection. The burrow system is set up as follows: a listening post chamber just under the surface and set off from the main burrow; a separate chamber that is used as a toilet and emptied periodically; and a nesting/sleeping chamber lined with dried grass. The nesting chambers are often elevated from the bottom of the tunnels so that the prairie dogs can remain dry when water flows into the burrow entrance."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What is the family structure of prairie dogs?,"Prairie dogs live in family groups with as many as 40 individuals, known as coteries, and have an elaborate system of communication."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What plans are in place to preserve land and dependent species?,"The Grassland Ecosystem Management plan identifies over 9000 acres where prairie dogs and their associated species will be protected.   These areas are designated as prairie dog conservation areas, multiple objective areas and grassland preserves."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What do prairie dogs eat and how does it impact the landscape?,"Prairie dogs feed on a variety of vegetation, including grasses and, to a lesser extent, seeds and insects. Grasses and other vegetation are clipped close to the ground to allow for a greater range of sight. Burrowing and feeding prairie dogs affect prairie ecosystems by: modifying the physical structure and nutrient composition of the soil; causing changes in plant species composition and density by clipping foliage and roots; and providing breeding or resting sites for a variety of other species."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,"How do prairie dogs impact open space, agriculture and urban environments?","Due to the dispersal activities of prairie dogs and the significant lack of predators in the urban environment, prairie dogs are often in conflict with urban land uses. Prairie dogs: can cause costly damage to agricultural crops, landscaping, earthen dams, airports and golf courses; often settle along the edges of preserved open space and on small, fragmented parcels where development has boxed in or pushed out the colony over time; and move from one site to adjacent properties and forage on lawns and established landscaping. In addition to causing damage, prairie dogs can be a safety hazard. Many of the prairie dog colonies within Boulder are located in transportation right-of-ways. As the colonies expand, they sometimes disperse across roads, causing potential hazards to themselves and motorists. On open space, prairie dogs are an important native species that supports an entire community of associated species.   However, some other grassland community types and plant and animal species do not thrive with prairie dog occupation, so the Grassland Plan provides conservation strategies for prairie dogs and other grassland community types and ecosystems.   In areas where cattle grazing overlaps with native grasslands, grazing and prairie dogs overlap and are not seen as competing land uses.   However, on irrigated agricultural lands, the presence of prairie dogs makes continued agricultural production difficult or impossible.   These areas are designated as removal or transition areas and open space will manage these to be prairie dog free when opportunities for relocation or natural population reduction lead to conditions where prairie dogs can be excluded."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What are the requirements for prairie dog management and control?,"City ordinance requires landowners to obtain a permit from the city before using any form of lethal control on prairie dogs. In order to obtain a permit, the landowner must demonstrate the following: a reasonable effort has been made to relocate the prairie dogs to another site; the most humane method of lethal control possible will be used; the land on which the prairie dogs are located will be developed within 15 months of the date of the application, a principal use of the land will be adversely impacted in a significant manner by the presence of prairie dogs on the site, or an established landscaping or open space feature will be adversely impacted by the prairie dogs; and the landowner has an adequate plan designed to prevent the reentry of prairie dogs onto the land after the prairie dogs are lawfully removed. Download the Prairie Dog Lethal Control Permit Application Form."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What is the waiting period for a permit?,"The waiting period after the submission of an application is a minimum of three to five months. If the city determines that relocation alternatives exist during or after the initial three-to-five month period, it may delay issuing the permit for an additional 12 months in order to allow relocation to occur."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What is the cost of a permit?,"The basic administrative fee for a permit is $1,500. An applicant for a prairie dog lethal control permit must also pay a fee of $1,200 per acre of active prairie dogs habitat lost, prorated for any partial acres of lost habitat."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,May I destroy a prairie dog burrow?,"No person may damage a prairie dog burrow unless at least one of the following circumstances exist: the burrow is uninhabited; the burrow is on the property of single-family residence; or the burrow was damaged in connection with an ongoing project or program that was pre-approved by the city manager. If you have development plans for your property that may be in conflict with prairie dogs on the site or if you have any questions about prairie dogs lethal control permits, visit the Urban Wildlife website. If prairie dogs are causing nuisance problems for you or the uses of your property, do not attempt to poison or kill the animals. Please call Urban Wildlife Conservation Coordinator Val Matheson at 303-441-3004."
Prairie Dogs,Animals,Planning Housing and Sustainability ,What are the requirements for relocation of prairie dogs?,"Landowners must provide the city with at least 20 days advance written notice of the initiation of the prairie dog relocation. Boulder's prairie dog protection history The history of Boulder's efforts to protect prairie dogs through legislation began in 1999. Concerns about the protection of prairie dogs arose from several incidents in Boulder and in some surrounding communities where large colonies of prairie dogs were poisoned. On Jan. 18, 2000, City Council adopted an ordinance prohibiting the poisoning of prairie dogs. The ordinance was amended on July 3, 2001 to prohibit destruction of active prairie dog burrows. In 2003, the Colorado Department of Agriculture notified the City of Boulder that the city's ordinance prohibiting prairie dog poisoning was preempted by state law regarding commercial pesticide applicators. The state's position was that the City of Boulder's ordinances needed to be either repealed or amended. City staff has since worked on revising the city's approach to the protection of prairie dogs. A study session was held with City Council in February 2004. At that session, Council endorsed the following ""six-step"" decision-making protocol for managing prairie dogs on private and public property. Minimize conflicts through non-removal methods. Remove prairie dogs on only a portion of a site. Evaluate the potential for relocation. Evaluate the potential for donation to animal recovery programs (which can include trapping and lethal control or live transfer). Evaluate the use of trapping and lethal control through carbon dioxide chambers. If the above steps are not feasible, apply poisons (fumitoxins) to the burrows. On Jan. 18, 2005, City Council adopted a final wildlife protection ordinance."

Public Tree Issues,Trees and Landscaping,Parks and Recreation ,Public Tree Issues,"Please do NOT use Inquire Boulder to report potentially dangerous tree situations (i.e. leaning or storm damaged trees, large broken branches hanging in trees, etc).   For these issues please contact the Urban Forestry office directly at 303-441-4406.   Forestry is currently receiving a high volume of calls due to emerald ash borer and tree damage. As a result, it could take up to a month for a Forestry staff person to respond to your request. If the request is for a tree emergency however, please contact the Forestry and Park Operations administrative staff directly at 303-441-4406 and specify that it is an emergency. Thank you.  Public Tree Issues: The Parks & Recreation Urban Forestry workgroup manages approximately 51,000 public trees in city parks and in street rights-of-way. Programs and services include: Rotational pruning for tree health and safety of public trees, Street Tree Planting program, Removal of dead, diseased or potentially dangerous trees, Tree Safety Inspection program, Integrated Pest Management program, Commercial Tree program, Arborist Licensing.  Urban Forestry prunes trees in city parks and in public street rights-of-way on a rotational basis to enhance tree health and ensure public safety. Trees are pruned to remove dead or broken branches, provide clearance over streets and sidewalks, improve branching structure, and to promote the overall health of trees. Currently, the street trees are on a 10-year pruning rotation and the city park trees on an 8-year pruning rotation. Trees will be pruned outside of the rotation only when there are large broken branches or large deadwood."
Public Tree Issues,Trees and Landscaping,Parks and Recreation ,When will my request be completed?,"That depends... For any potentially dangerous public tree pruning/removal requests and emergency situations, please state that it is an emergency in the request or call the Forestry office directly at 303-441-4406. For emergency requests, staff will inspect the tree within 24 hours and remedy the situation as soon as possible depending upon the severity of the situation. All general pruning requests are inspected by Forestry staff within two weeks and prioritized accordingly. Lower priority requests may be put on an upcoming contract or may need to wait until the next pruning rotation. Most city contracted tree work occurs in the fall or winter for efficiency reasons and because it's better for the overall health of the trees.   Adjacent property owners are permitted to prune street trees on public property; however, city code requires that you hire only a licensed certified arborist to prune public trees.

Sanitary Sewer Maintenance,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Sanitary Sewer Maintenance,"The City of Boulder owns and maintains about 355 miles of sewer pipe with more than 9,200 manholes. The sewer department performs routine maintenance and cleaning of the sanitary sewer collection system as well as responding to emergency maintenance events as needed.   Sanitary sewer maintenance includes routine testing to determine if there are structural deficiencies and improper connections with the city sanitary sewer system. For these tests nontoxic smoke is blown into the sewer system at manholes along the city sewer mains and city crews look for the smoke to surface to locate sewer connections and potential problem areas. This is called smoke testing and is a technique used to find deficiencies in the sanitary sewer system and improper connections that are allowing unwanted groundwater and storm water into the sewers. The city's sanitary sewer system is a separate system from the city's storm sewer system and it is not intended to convey excessive groundwater or stormwater. Smoke testing helps city crews identify the approximate location of the deficiencies and improper connections so that follow up investigations and repairs can be performed. If smoke testing is scheduled in your area, you will receive the following Smoke Testing Sewer Lines Notice. For more information, please review the Smoke Testing Sewer Lines FAQs. Normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday-Friday. After hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as sewer backups, overflows and missing manhole covers. To report an emergency issue including a missing manhole cover, sewage backup, sewage overflow (sewer discharge out of a manhole) or outside sewer odor, please call 303-441-3200 between 7 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday-Friday. At any other time, please call 303-441-3245.   Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.   In the event of a sewer backup on your property, the city will respond and determine the cause of the backup and assist if possible. Sewer customers should be aware that the sanitary sewer service line is the responsibility of the property owner up to and including the connection to the city-owned sewer main. If the problem is determined to be in the sewer service line, it is recommend that you call a plumber to investigate and resolve the problem. For all non-emergency sewer issues, please submit a service request for this item in the 'Make a Service Request' area below. Do NOT use Inquire Boulder to request utility locates prior to digging. All requests for utility locates must go through the 811 dispatch center. For more information on locating underground utilities, please see the Locate an Underground Utility page."

School zone flashing beacons are placed at locations where school-age children cross the street, and in front of school areas where student pickup and drop-off occurs. The flashing schedule for each zone is determined based on the bell schedule for the school(s) associated with the zone. Typically, the flashing beacons begin operation 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the school day, and continue flashing until 10 minutes after class begins. At the end of the school day, the beacons begin flashing 5 minutes before student dismissal, and continue for 30 minutes after school ends.

Sewer Backup Prevention,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Sewer Backup Prevention,"Boulder's sanitary sewer system consists of underground pipes that utilize gravity to collect and transport untreated wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial properties to the city's wastewater treatment facility. This wastewater collection system consists of 355 miles of city-owned sewers and an estimated equal length of privately owned sewer laterals that connect properties to the city's main. The City of Boulder provides routine maintenance, cleaning, and rehabilitation of the city-owned sewer system; however, there is the potential for an unforeseeable sewer blockage or excessive inflow of stormwater into both the city's sewers and privately-owned laterals during extreme rain events. If such an event occurs, wastewater may back up into a building through floor drains, sinks, showers or toilets. Boulder wastewater customers that reside in areas that are prone to such events, including historic districts and low-lying areas, may experience sewer backups. Customers with basements and below-ground properties may also have an increased likelihood of sewer backups. These customers may choose to install backwater valves on their sewer laterals, which are designed to temporarily block sewer pipes and prevent sewage from flowing back up a private sewer lateral. Backwater valves are designed to close either automatically via a float system or manually by closing a valve to prevent wastewater from backing up into a building. While backwater valves are closed, customers cannot use any plumbing fixtures such as toilets or sinks. Once backwater valves are reopened, wastewater resumes its regular flow through the sewer pipes. Licensed plumbers should evaluate each property's specific plumbing configurations to determine whether a backwater valve can be installed in accordance with Uniform Plumbing Code and then provide recommendations about the correct types of devices to use and where to install them. All types of backwater valves must be regularly cleaned, inspected, tested and maintained to ensure that they are functioning properly. A City of Boulder plumbing permit and inspection are required and all types of backwater valves must be installed on existing sanitary sewer lines by a licensed plumbing contractor. Private property owners can also purchase insurance coverage for sewer backups. Visit bouldercolorado.gov/flood/flood-insurance or www.floodsmart.gov for details."

SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,What information do I need to provide for EnergySmart enrollment?,"The enrollment process requires your contact information and some basic details about your rental such as year built, number of bedrooms and utility information. In order to enroll your rental(s), electric and gas utility account numbers must be provided. There is a Utility Release Form that must be signed by the person whose name appears on the utility bills. If a tenant receives the utility bills, then the tenant must complete the form. The utility account information is used to track energy usage history for homes in Boulder County. The data used is strictly energy usage. No personal information associated with your utility account is obtained during the process. Scheduling is the final step of enrollment. Depending on the size and configuration of the rental, inspections usually last about two hours."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,What do my tenants need to do?,"If a tenant's name appears on the utility bills for the rental, then that tenant will have to complete a Utility Release Form if a landlord has enrolled for free EnergySmart Advising.

No fire or significant heat is allowed during the SmartRegs Inspection."

SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Can I choose a specific SmartRegs Inspector to work with?,"Yes.

SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Who will be attending the SmartRegs Inspection?,"If enrolled in EnergySmart, you may choose to have two people attending the inspection. The SmartRegs Inspector will perform a technical analysis of the rental, and an EnergySmart Advisor can attend at your request to answer general energy efficiency questions and provide some free quick-install items."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,How can I reach my EnergySmart Advisor?,"You can email your advisor. If you wish to speak with your advisor, you can contact a Project Administrator who will transfer the call if the advisor is available. The advisors are also conducting assessments throughout the day, so they will not always be available to take the call."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Can a SmartRegs Inspection be done under any conditions?,No. A SmartRegs Inspection cannot be done if the rental is undergoing retrofits or construction.

SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Am I obligated to make upgrades to the rental after the inspection?,"If your rental does not pass the inspection, then upgrades will be required so that the rental passes a follow-up inspection. The free EnergySmart Advisor is provided to assist you with upgrade decisions and contractor selection once you are ready to pursue the recommended upgrades."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Do I have to make all of the upgrades if the rental does not pass an inspection?,"Not necessarily. Enough upgrades have to be made so that you reach 100 points during the next inspection. For example, if the rental scores 80 initially, then you must complete enough upgrades to receive 20 more points. A free EnergySmart Advisor can assist you with figuring out which upgrades to make so it's as cost-effective as possible."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,How do I know that the contractor I hire is qualified?,"The contractors partnering with EnergySmart go through an application process with Boulder County. Although we are not responsible for the work done by any individual contractor, we do perform quality assurance evaluations in order to verify that the contractors are meeting the standards that Boulder County has set for them."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,What happens if my rental passes a SmartRegs Inspection?,"If your rental passes a SmartRegs Inspection, the inspector will submit paperwork to the City of Boulder showing that the rental is SmartRegs compliant. No upgrades will need to be made. The inspector may choose to provide you with a list of recommendations that you can choose to follow through with, if you wish. Rebates:"
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Are there other rebates available in addition to the SmartRegs and EnergySmart rebates?,"There are typically rebates available through Xcel Energy in addition to Federal tax credits. There may also be EnergySmart program rebates available to you. EnergySmart Advisors can assist with identifying and applying for the applicable rebates for upgrades you may be interested in pursuing. I recently installed a new furnace, and my SmartRegs Inspection is tomorrow."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Can I receive a SmartRegs or EnergySmart rebate for the furnace?,No. EnergySmart rebates cannot be used retroactively for upgrades completed prior to the SmartRegs Inspection. Exceptions
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,"I know SmartRegs is mandatory, but I am not sure that I can afford it, so what can I do?","If tenants meet low-income standards, you can take advantage of a program provided by Longs Peak Energy Conservation that provides free weatherization for households that fall under specific income levels. An EnergySmart Project Administrator can direct you to the Longs Peak website, where you can find information about the program and download an application for your tenants. Any rental that receives weatherization through Longs Peak is considered SmartRegs compliant."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Do newly-constructed rentals need to comply with SmartRegs energy efficiency requirements?,"Buildings that can be verified as meeting or exceeding the energy efficiency requirements of the Energy Conservation and Insulation Code, Chapter 10-7, BRC 1981 will be considered compliant. These are typically homes built in Boulder after July 2001. An application must still be submitted, noting the construction date. City staff will verify compliance and issue a certificate of compliance, if approved."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Does a basement apartment in my house need a SmartRegs Inspection?,"Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) or attached Owner Accessory Units (OAU) do not need a SmartRegs Inspection. An ADU or attached OAU is generally considered any rental unit that is physically attached to the unit that the owner occupies. The rental license should specify whether the rental is an ADU, which can be verified by the City of Boulder."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,What about on-campus housing?,"Dorms do not typically hold a rental license, which would mean they do not have to comply."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,Do mobile homes need SmartRegs Inspections?,"Mobile homes are inspected by the State of Colorado and therefore do not need a SmartRegs Inspection. To verify compliance by way of this exception, an application must still be submitted with the appropriate exception box checked. City staff will verify compliance and issue a certificate of compliance if approved."
SmartRegs,"Licensing, Permits and Fees/Taxes",Public Works ,The rental property I own is very old; does it still need a SmartRegs Inspection?,"Yes. All rental properties must pass a SmartRegs Inspection. If a rental cannot be upgraded in any way because of its age or structural details, then a SmartRegs Inspector can designate the rental as ""Technically Impractical"" with respect to making upgrades. The City of Boulder will review the inspector's findings and approve these exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Landlords are required to purchase carbon offsets in lieu of any checklist points they are unable to claim due to technical impracticality."

Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Train Noise and Quiet Zones,For the Latest Information: You can find the latest information about the city's quiet zones project and how to stay updated by visiting the city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page.
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Who owns the railroad tracks in Boulder?,Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway owns and operates all railroad tracks in the City of Boulder.
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Who controls the railroad crossings in the Boulder area?,"There are ten crossings in the immediate vicinity of Boulder. Five are on roads controlled by the city and five are on county-controlled roads. Therefore, the city and county are coordinating to establish quiet zones in the Boulder area, as federal rules stipulate that the agency that controls the road at the crossing must apply for Quiet Zone status."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Who regulates the sounding of train horns at railroad crossings?,The sounding of train horns at crossings is regulated by federal rules from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Why has train noise increased in recent years?,"We understand that train horn noise has increased over the past decade, despite the number of trains passing through our community remaining fairly stable. This is due to federal rules, which were adopted in 2005, mandating a consistent pattern and decibel level of horn sounding at public at-grade crossings. Previously, locomotive engineers had more discretion as to when the train horn was sounded, and could, for example, choose not to sound the train horn at a given crossings at night if no hazards were present on the tracks. The federal rules now require that all trains sound horns between 96 and 110 decibels at all public crossings. However, in the same 2005 rulemaking process, the FRA established a process by which road authorities can establish ""quiet zones,"" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horns at crossings. Information concerning quiet zones is available at http://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889"
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,What can legally be done to decrease train noise at crossings?,"The same 2005 FRA rules that governed the blowing of horns also established a process by which local governments can establish ""quiet zones,"" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horn at all crossings. Information on the use of locomotive horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings can be found on the FRA website."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,How are quiet zones established?,"Crossings considered for Quiet Zone establishment are evaluated by a diagnostic team consisting of the road authority who owns and maintains the roadway, the railroad operating over the crossing, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, and the Colorado Department of Transportation. There are several crossing improvement treatments that are pre-approved by the FRA called Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs). These improvements can include a combination of features such as railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and construction of raised medians. Each crossing is evaluated to determine which treatments are needed at the crossing. Crossings treated with SSMs require only a notification to the FRA for Quiet Zone establishment. The cost for these installations is higher, but use of SSM treatments results in a permanent Quiet Zone. Another option for Quiet Zone establishment is through the use of Alternative Safety Measures (ASMs). These are typically non-engineering solutions such as photo enforcement. This option requires an application to the FRA along with documentation to support the selected treatment. Once applied for, the FRA will evaluate the treatment and approve or deny the application. Approval of ASM alternatives includes stipulations regarding enforcement, monitoring and reporting to the FRA on a regular basis. If any incidents occur, or the stipulations are not met, the Quiet Zone designation can be revoked."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,What is the cost of establishing a quiet zone?,"The diagnostic review at each crossing helps the team determine what infrastructure is currently in place, and what, if any additional installations are necessary to meet the requirements of one of the SSM treatments. Addition of gates, flashers, bells, and railroad circuitry can cost $350,000. Crossings that already have the railroad equipment may only need the construction of raised medians, which can be done for under $50,000 per crossing. The cost is based on what crossing warning devices and roadway features exist at the crossing when it is evaluated for consideration of Quiet Zone establishment. There is no readily available documentation of costs for Quiet Zone establishment using ASMs. While the infrastructure cost may be lower than an SSM treatment, the cost of enforcement, monitoring and reporting over a longer period of time may result in expenditures relatively comparable to the SSM treatment."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,"How difficult is it to establish a ""quiet zone?","Colorado is home to 10 Quiet Zones in 6 different communities. The process involves a cooperative effort between the road authority, railroad, and agencies with jurisdiction over crossing and roadway safety (Colorado Public Utilities Commission and Colorado Department of Transportation). Use of SSM treatments, while more costly, result in a shorter timeline to Quiet Zone establishment because the SSM treatments have been tested and approved by the FRA. Crossings with much of the equipment already present can be established as Quiet Zones in less than one year. Crossings requiring a greater amount of equipment installation or roadway construction can be established as Quiet Zones in 18 months to three years. However, implementation estimates assume funding sources that are already identified. The City of Boulder received $1.2 million from the Denver Regional Council of Governments for quiet zone design and construction. The city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page has the latest information on this project."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,"In the case of an accident at a railroad crossing, who is liable?","The first Quiet Zone in Colorado was established in Commerce City in 2007. The crossings involved were treated with SSMs, which result in warning devices at the crossings to make the crossings safer. There have been no incidents at these crossings since Quiet Zone establishment, even though trains are not sounding their horns. The FRA has indicated that the courts will ultimately determine who will be held liable if a collision occurs at a grade crossing located within a Quiet Zone, as the collision may have been caused by factors other than the absence of an audible warning. The Final Rule is intended to remove ""failure to sound the locomotive horn"" as a cause of action in lawsuits involving collisions at grade crossings located within Quiet Zones. Therefore, FRA expects that the courts will determine liability issues based on the facts of each case, the FRA's regulatory intent and the nature of this rule and its Federal requirements."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Do quiet zones increase the likelihood of accidents at railroad crossings?,"Crossings treated with SSMs, which can include a combination of railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and raised medians, are treated with engineered solutions that provide visual, audible and physical warning at a grade crossing that a train is approaching. These crossings are, by default, safer crossings, as they have more infrastructure and warning devices that discourage, and in some cases, physically prohibit a motorist from entering the tracks during approach of a train. Accidents at crossings treated with SSMs have no more likelihood of occurring than at standard crossings you may see that have approach railroad gates that descend when activated by an approaching train. Crossings treated with ASM solutions, which include non-engineered options, may not have any additional warning devices installed as part of the treatment, but also no longer have train horns sounding. There are currently no Quiet Zones that have been successfully established with non-engineered solutions. Therefore, there are no statistics to support a higher rate of accidents at this time."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,Are quiet zones really quiet?,"Experts estimate that 90 percent of train noise comes from blowing the horns, so quiet zones can make a significant difference. Other noise comes from the engines and from train wheels, particularly on curved sections of track. A variety of infrastructure improvements can be used at quiet zones. Some communities have chosen to replace the train-mounted horns with horns mounted on the poles at the crossings. The pole-mounted horns are more directional (aimed down at the railway), which can reduce the number of homes and businesses impacted by the noise. Whether or not these pole-mounted horns are appropriate for some Boulder crossings is being explored by staff."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,What is the city currently doing about quiet zones?,"City staff has been following this issue for many years and working with the regional partners including Boulder County, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Regional Transportation District (RTD), neighboring communities, and the BNSF, FRA and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. The city commissioned a Railroad Quiet Zone study to refine cost estimates for implementing quiet zones at the BNSF railroad crossings in and near the City of Boulder (this includes several crossings located in Boulder County). This work also provides a clearer picture of the actual needs at individual railroad crossings as well as necessary potential education and enforcement programs. The city conducted a public engagement process with the community to inform a prioritization and phasing plan for implementation. Projects have been prioritized as follows: 47th Street, Valmont Road, Pearl Parkway, 63rd Street at the Diagonal Highway, 55th Street north of Arapahoe Avenue, 63rd Street north of Arapahoe Avenue. Previous discussions with RTD with regard to the Northwest Rail line can be found in the Guidelines for City of Boulder Participation in the Northwest Rail Environmental Evaluation."
Train Noise and Quiet Zones,Transportation,Public Works ,What is RTD's involvement in helping to establish quiet zones?,"City staff has also been following this issue for many years and working with the Regional Transportation Division (RTD) and other partners to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. RTD is planning to construct quiet zone improvements along much of the Northwest (NW) Rail corridor if it is built, which is currently estimated for 2030 and beyond. The city continues to work with RTD and other agency partners to bring rail and its associate improvements to the corridor within a more reasonable timeline than currently proposed.

Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off Private Property to Elsewhere,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off Private Property to Elsewhere,"Water Being Pumped or Diverted from One Private Property onto Another: The City of Boulder does not regulate the discharge or diversion of water from one private property onto another private property. If you believe you have suffered damages or other impacts to your private property due to the activities of neighboring property owners diverting or discharging water, you may wish to consult with a private attorney to explore your legal rights. The city cannot provide legal advice to people who believe they have suffered damages due to an adjacent or nearby property owner diverting water onto a neighbor's property. If any fence, wall or berm was (or is) being constructed to divert drainage without a building permit, contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to alert an inspector of the possible violation. Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off of Private Property onto Public Property like Sidewalks, Streets or Gutters: The City of Boulder regulates the discharge or diversion of water onto public property under the Boulder Revised Code Chapter 8-2-8: Discharging Water Prohibited. Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines. To report water being pumped or diverted onto any public property such as an alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, right-of-way, or street, call 303-441-4237 or ""Make a Service Request"" below."
Water Seepage,Water and Sewer,Public Works ,Water Seepage,"Water Seeping into BasementsThe level of groundwater (the depth below ground where the soil is saturated, also called the water table) varies throughout Boulder and some areas have a higher water table than others. Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you. If you can see the source of the water and it's bubbling or spraying up from under the ground or roadway, call 303-441-3200 from 7 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or 303-441-3249 after-hours, to report a water main (pipe) break."
