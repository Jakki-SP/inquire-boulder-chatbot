       "      <td>The City of Boulder is committed to making housing in our community available to a variety of people, including those who could not otherwise purchase a home in Boulder's housing market. The Division of Housing offers opportunities for homeownership to those with low and moderate incomes - from down payment assistance on market rate homes to homes that must be sold at affordable prices. How long does it take to become income-certified? Generally up to two weeks. Who needs to be on the application? Everyone who lives in the household or is part of the household, in addition to all people who will be listed on the property title. Household members should include all individuals: legal spouse, domestic partner, or common-law spouse; children(under 18 who reside with the applicant at least 50 percent of the time; and/or a significant other whom the applicant chooses to include as a member of his/her household, who will be occupying the house. The applicant's spouse must be included unless they are legally divorced or separated. Persons not counted include foster children, unborn children, and children under 18 who reside with the applicant less then 50 percent of the time. How is annual income calculated? Annual income is defined as the anticipated total income for the next 12-month period received from all sources by each member (over the age of 18) of the household. It is assumed that today's circumstances will continue for the next 12 months. The applicant is required to verify this by either submitting a letter from his/her employer stating his/her annual wage or by completing an employer verification form. To obtain this form, call the Housing Division at 303-441-3157 ext. 2. How is income verified for self-employed people? Self-employed individuals should submit copies of their last three years of federal income-tax forms and must also submit an up-to-date profit/loss statement. How are assets calculated? Assets are calculated based on annual income earned (interest), not the value of the asset itself. Can I combine any programs? Neither First Home (20 percent down payment) nor the House to Home (15 percent down payment) Assistance Programs can be combined with a HomeWorks (permanently affordable) Home, since these homes have already been subsidized by the City of Boulder or the developer. The 3 percent solution may be used with HomeWorks. Can I have a cosigner? Yes, a non-occupying cosigner will not be included in the household. However, if the cosigner's name appears on the title, her/his income must be included in the income certification application. Do I have to be a first-time home buyer? To qualify for the down payment assistance programs, you must be a first-time home buyer, which means you have not owned a home in the last three years unless you have been divorced (in the last three years) or are a displaced homemaker. You do not have to be a first-time home buyer to purchase an Affordable Home. Do I have to purchase in the city limits of Boulder? Yes. Find out if the property is located in the Boulder City Limits. How are improvements calculated for Affordable Homes? The low-income covenant lists all of the pre-approved capital improvements. The home owner should contact the city before the improvement has begun in order to ensure how the improvement will be calculated into the resale price. Homeowners are allowed to add a maximum of $25,000 to the resale calculation for pre-approved capital improvements. For more information, please visit the Affordable Homeownership Program website.</td>\n",

The City of Boulder animal noise ordinance states that it is unlawful for an owner to allow an animal to disturb the peace by barking, howling, whining, crowing, baying, or making any other loud and persistent or loud and habitual noise. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. How can I deal with a barking dog? If a dog is causing a nuisance and disturbing your peace, there are some steps you can follow to help resolve the issue. The first step to take is to try and talk with your neighbor. Many people are unaware that their dog barks when they are absent. They may not be aware that their dog's barking is bothering you. Speaking with the dog guardian often solves the problem. If you are uncomfortable speaking with your neighbor, a polite note placed on the front door or mailed to the address can help make them aware of the problem. While the city does recommend trying to solve the dispute with your neighbor to reach an amiable solution on your own, speaking with your neighbor is a suggestion and not a requirement when dealing with barking dogs. If attempting to address the barking dog problem on your own fails, call the Boulder Police Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report the problem. Be prepared to provide Animal Protection with the following information: the address of the barking dog; exact date(s) and time(s) of the barking, preferably the most recent occurrence; and a description of the dog(s), if you can provide one. The City of Boulder has a two-step process when dealing with nuisance dogs. Once you have provided the necessary information, Boulder Police Animal Protection will contact the dog's guardian and issue a written warning. Animal Protection will meet with the guardian in person to help them identify what is causing the barking and try to find a solution. In accordance with city ordinance, a written warning must be issued prior to a summons being served. After the warning is issued, give the guardian 10 to 14 days to identify the cause and possible resolutions to the nuisance barking. Many times, guardians need to utilize trial and error to discover which bark-control methods work best for their dog If the written warning is not successful and additional enforcement action must be taken, two reporting parties are required for a court summons to be issued. The reporting parties will need to complete witness statements for the same date/time/duration for a court summons to be issued. Why do dogs bark? Dogs bark for many reasons, and determining what causes the barking is the first tool to begin to resolve the problem behavior. Some common reasons that dogs bark are listed below. Boredom/loneliness - Dogs are pack animals, are not solitary, and do not like to be left alone. They need a lot of attention and stimulation. Territorial/protection - Dogs will bark at people or animals that come near their territory to get them to leave. This can often appear to be aggressive behavior. Separation anxiety - Dogs with separation anxiety often bark excessively when left alone. Dogs who have separation anxiety will often pace and exhibit destructive behavior. Alarm/fear - Some dogs will bark at anything that startles them or catches their attention. There are many things throughout a day that may startle a dog. Be a good neighborA barking dog can be disruptive to your neighbors and can put a strain on your relationship. It can also lead to a court summons if allowed to continue. There are many ways to help curb your dog's barking. A few common methods are listed below. Give your dog a special toy or long-lasting treat to entertain them while you are away. Daily exercise will stimulate your dog both physically and mentally, making them a much calmer, more enjoyable pet. Ultra-sonic bark control devices are typically placed outside around the yard and emit a high-pitched sound every time the dog barks. Citronella bark collars spray an unpleasant smell towards the dog's nose every time they bark. Electronic bark collars emit a static electric charge when the dog is barking.</td>\n",

Boulder Animal Protection is a division of the Boulder Police Department that enforces all city ordinances related to animals and state laws related to domestic animals. Animal Protection responds to animal-related complaints and promotes responsible pet ownership through enforcement, mediation and education. Officers investigate and respond to: roaming dogs; dangerous or aggressive animals; animal bites; cruelty and/or neglect to animals; animal noise (barking dogs); excess animal feces; leash law and tethering violations; dog licensing violations; and injured and orphaned small wildlife. Animal Rules and RegulationsThe City of Boulder's animal laws were developed to ensure the health and safety of residents and their pets. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. Leash lawAll dogs in the City of Boulder must be kept on leashes at all times unless they are confined to their owner's property. Dogs that roam loose present a danger to the community and may be hit by a car or attacked by other animals. An exception for your dog to run free is to utilize one of the designated off-leash dog parks. If you have obtained an Open Space &amp; Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag for your dog, you must utilize the designated opens space areas that are participating in that program. Rabies vaccinationCity of Boulder law requires all dogs and cats over the age of four months to be vaccinated against rabies. After the initial vaccination, animals must be kept current on rabies vaccinations using either a one-year or three-year vaccination. All vaccinations must be provided by a Colorado-licensed veterinarian. City of Boulder dog licenseA City of Boulder dog license is required for all dogs over the age of four months living within the city limits. The license serves as identification to enable officers to contact you if your dog is lost or injured, and to ensure that your dog is currently vaccinated against rabies. The license must be obtained within 30 days of acquiring the dog or within 30 days of moving to Boulder. In order to purchase a city dog license, a guardian must provide proof of a current rabies vaccination. All dogs are required to wear their City of Boulder dog license tag on their collar or harness at all times. Keep in mind that the Open Space &amp; Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag is not a substitute for a city dog license. Aggressive animalsNo person shall own or keep any aggressive animal. An aggressive animal is one that approaches a person in a vicious or terrorizing attitude of attack. An animal that bites, claws, or attempts to bite or claw any person, or bites or injures another animal, will be considered a vicious animal. Be sure to keep your pets under control at all times to prevent an incident such as an attack or bite. Animal cruelty or neglectAll animals in Boulder are legally protected from being abandoned, beaten, tortured, injured, transported in an unsafe manner, or killed. Failure to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, grooming, opportunity for exercise, or sanitary conditions is a violation of city ordinance. Violators will be strictly prosecuted for these infractions. Barking dog nuisance Boulder's animal noise ordinance states that it is unlawful for an owner to allow an animal to disturb the peace with loud and habitual barking, howling, whining, or baying. If you notice that your dog barks unnecessarily, it is your responsibility to identify the problem and resolve it immediately to prevent a disturbance to your neighborhood. Clean up after your animalPicking up your pet's waste is required by city ordinance. It is an important way to help preserve our environment and prevent the spread of disease. Please be courteous to other Boulder community members by cleaning up after your pet. CatsWhile not subject to leash and licensing laws, cats must be vaccinated against rabies beginning at four months of age. Cats must also be restrained from creating a nuisance by leaving feces or damaging the property of another. If a cat is causing a nuisance by defecating or destroying property, a property owner has the legal right to remove the cat from their property and bring it to the local animal shelter. The guardian may also be charged with owning a nuisance cat. Impound and board fees apply to impounded cats. Strict liability Boulder animal laws are strict liability laws. Therefore, an animal's guardian is liable even when there is no proof of negligence or intent. The guardian is responsible for their animal's actions, regardless of the circumstances, accidental or otherwise. If an animal injures, kills, or damages any person, other animal, or property, the strict liability law holds the guardian or keeper of the animal legally responsible, and includes all costs and damages incurred. PenaltiesIn addition to impoundment fees, guardians are subject to a court summons for violations of the city animal ordinances. The maximum penalty for each violation is $1,000 and/or 90 days in jail. Fines are subject to increase for subsequent violations.</td>\n",

Service requests submitted online will receive a response within four business days (7:00 am - 5:00 pm, except holidays). Bear Resistant Container Required 6-3-12 - LIMITED WARNINGS will be issued for this violation. The purpose of this chapter is to protect native wildife and the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the secure storage of trash and compost materials from being accessible to bears and other wildlife. Visit boulderwildlifeplan.net for additional information. Am I required to have a bear-resistant container?  If so, by when? Residents living in the Secure Trash Regulation Zone are required to have and properly use bear-resistant containers for compost and trash by June 15, 2016. Bear Continers and dumpsters need to be latched at all times. Click here for video on how to use the Western Disposal bear containers and dumpsters.Does the new ordinance only apply to trash and compost, or does it also apply to recycling?    Ordinance No. 7962 requires trash and compost to be secured at all times in a bear-resistant cart, dumpster, or enclosure. Recycling is excluded from the requirements of the ordinance. Residents are also required  to store all waste and recycle containers so that the contents are not scattered by animals, wind, or other elements.  My compost and trash containers are stored in my garage at all times except when placed at the curb on the morning of waste collection. Do I still need a bear-resistant cart? Yes, trash and compost containers need to be secure at all times until collected by a waste hauler. If you put your containers outside at any time (even just before pick-up on the morning of collection), the carts or containers must be bear-resistant. Can I still bag my leaves and grass for pick-up?  Yes, landscape material can be bagged in paper lawn and leaf bags. However, do not add any food waste or other attractants to yard waste to prevent it from being scattered. Any scattered items are still subject to possible enforcement. If I want to build an outdoor enclosure for my compost and trash carts, will I need a building permit?  If so, are there any exemptions from other city regulatory procedures?   Bear Resistant enclosures that are fixed in-place and designed to shelter or protect any kind of property are required to satisfy all applicable codes and regulations, including (but not limited to) minimum setbacks, building separation, maximum building coverage, site triangles, etc. In most residential zoning districts, some types of outdoor enclosures may contribute to the property's maximum allowed floor area ratio (FAR) if the floor-to-ceiling height within the enclosure is greater than six feet. Contact Planning and Development Services at 303-441-1880 or plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to discuss the specifications of your proposed enclosure with a Project Specialist so they can provide information specific to your property. Project Specialists are generally available for walk-in consultations during P&amp;DS business hours. Can I develop my own securing system to make my trash and compost carts \"bear-resistant\"?  I have a system that works well and have never had a problem with bears.No. The city's \"bear-resistant\" standard includes specific minimum requirements in the Rule Establishing Requirements for Bear-Resistant Containers, Dumpsters and Enclosures.

       "      <td>Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) has provided this list of frequently asked questions about bear management in the City of Boulder. The CPW is responsible for the direct management of all wildlife in the state. For more information, visit the Living with Bears in Colorado webpage. Why are there bears in Boulder? The land surrounding Boulder, including Open Space and Mountain Parks, U.S. Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties, and the mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for bears. Bears find food in the form of garbage, compost, bird seed, barbecue grills, pet food, and fruit from trees. There is an abundance of water from various creeks, ditches, wetlands and backyard water features (fountains and ponds). Bear sightings are most common west of Broadway, but it is not uncommon for bears to be seen in the east part of Boulder. Do we have grizzly bears in Colorado? No, all bears in Colorado are black bears, regardless of whether the coat is black, brown, blond or cinnamon-colored. The last confirmed grizzly bear in Colorado was seen in 1979. Why can't CPW take all of the bears out of town and keep them out? There is no simple way to keep bears out of the city. Because abundant, high-quality habitat exists around the City of Boulder, there will always be bears in town to some extent. In some cases, bears in Boulder may be relocated, though this often is not an ideal solution. Young bears may be somewhat more likely to stay in the area they are moved to. There are, as of yet, no proven techniques to exclude bears from large areas like Boulder, though minimizing human attractants and food sources does help. What is the two strike policy, and what does it mean if a bear is ear-tagged? The CPW has a \"two-strike\" policy under which bears may be tranquilized, ear-tagged and relocated once if they are in an inappropriate location (for example, too far into town), or they have engaged in episode(s) of \"nuisance\" behavior (multiple visits to town, light property damage, etc.). If that same bear has to be physically dealt with again (tranquilized or trapped due to inappropriate location or nuisance behavior), the bear is put down. Bears that pose a public safety risk will be put down regardless of whether they have ear tags or not. What does CPW do about bears in town?  When are they relocated or killed? The response from CPW will depend on a variety of factors such as location, time of day, history of the bear in town, whether the bear is already ear-tagged, and current behavior. In these cases, the CPW will educate the neighborhood about bear attractants, often via media releases, volunteers going door-to-door and posting signs. Hazing of bears in Boulder (using air horns, banging pots and pans, yelling) is also encouraged in order to make the bear feel uncomfortable around humans. If the bear is in a location where it can be left unbothered, the CPW will often notify immediate neighbors and leave it alone, or leave it with a city or CPW \"bear-sitter\" who can keep an eye on the bear and notify neighbors when the bear moves. That bear will often move back onto open space on its own, usually after dark. Capturing the bear is a last resort, and will only be attempted if less-intensive management options are not effective or appropriate. If the bear has not been captured before, it will be ear-tagged and relocated. If the bear is already ear-tagged, it will be put down. Bears considered to be a public safety risk will not be relocated, but will be put down regardless of whether they are ear-tagged or not. What can I do to keep myself, my kids and my pets safe? Educate yourself and everyone in your house about bears about how to reduce attractants on your property and in your neighborhood. A great place to start is the Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) website. The CPW recommends that children be supervised when outside in bear, mountain lion and coyote habitat. The risk of injury or death to humans, including children, from bears, is low. Teach your children to be aware of wildlife and what to do if they encounter wildlife. An easy acronym to remember is SMART: S - Stop, do not run. M - Make yourself look big. A - Announce \"Leave me alone!\" R - Retreat - back away slowly. T - Tell an adult. Practicing scenarios ahead of time can better prepare children for an unexpected encounter with wildlife, including bears. Bears do not usually bother pets or target them as food items, and are often afraid of dogs. How can I reduce the chance of a bear coming onto or near my property? Containing food items and other smelly attractants is the best way to reduce the chances that bears will show interest in your property. When bears successfully seek out human food sources, it increases the chances they will repeatedly come into the City of Boulder to forage. Garbage and compost should be kept in a shed or garage until the morning of pickup, or kept in a bear-resistant trash container so that the bear will not be able to access the food items. Birdfeeders should either be removed from April through November or hung in such a manner that prevents bears from accessing it. Pet food should not be left outside and should be removed as soon as your pet has finished eating. Barbeque grills should be stored in a garage or cleaned thoroughly after each use. The fruit trees that grow in many parts of Boulder can serve as an attractant to bears from mid-summer into the fall. CPW recommends that residents pick up fallen fruit on a regular basis and reconsider planting new fruit trees. Residents can also pick fruit on trees to further minimize attractants. Backyard ponds can serve as an attractant to bears, particularly in the warmer months. Residents concerned about bears near their property should consider draining these ponds. Reducing bear attractants is a community effort, and talking with your neighbors about the importance of keeping attractants contained will benefit both people and bears. When are bears most active?  Is it unusual to see a bear in the middle of the day? Bears are generally most active at dusk, throughout the night, and into the dawn hours. This is often when they are foraging and moving around. However, it is not unusual or abnormal to see bears in the middle of the day. In the fall months, bears need to feed up to 20 hours a day to prepare for hibernation. Hibernation dates can vary depending on the weather, available food sources, and the individual bear, but bears generally will enter hibernation in mid-late November and emerge in early-mid April. What do bears eat? Bears are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of plant and animal materials. Potential food sources include garbage, compost, bird seed, food from barbecue grills, pet food left outside, and fruit from trees. Bears are frequent visitors because all of these attractants exist within Boulder. Why can't we feed bears to keep them out of town? CPW does not feed bears outside of Boulder during difficult years because it does not solve the problem of bears coming into town and doing so is bad for the bears. Natural food is difficult, but it is not impossible, to find. Feeding bears reduces their motivation and ability to find food, which may cause bears to become dependent on artificial feeding stations for survival. A single habitat can only support a certain number of bears in a given year. If the CPW were to artificially increase the availability of food for bears around Boulder by feeding them, it would artificially increase local bear populations through a higher breeding success rate and lower mortality. What are the risks to humans from bears? During the last several decades, there have been three fatalities and 37 incidents in which a person was injured by a black bear in Colorado. Many of these incidents involved the bear either being intentionally fed or being unintentionally habituated to people. There are many things you can do to lower the risk of injury from bears, including removing any attractants around your home and staying alert and aware when you are in any forest, park, or open space area. What is considered aggressive bear behavior? Many times what appears to be aggressive behavior of bears is more likely defensive behavior. When they feel threatened, defensive bears will: \"pop\" their jaws; make low moaning sounds; \"huff\" or exhale quickly to try to demonstrate that they are \"tough and strong;\" and/or \"false charge\" by running at the threat but stopping before they reach it. Aggressive behavior is rare in black bears. Examples of aggressive behavior would be if a bear, despite having easy ways to escape, approached people or if a bear entered a tent and injured someone. Who should I call when I see a bear? For general bear information, including advice for living with bears, call Colorado Parks and Wildlife at 303-291-7227 or visit the Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) website. To report sightings within the City of Boulder, call the: Boulder Police non-emergency number at 303-441-3333; or Colorado Parks and Wildlife (during business hours) at 303-291-7227. Call 911 in the event of an immediate human safety issue, or if a human or pet is injured by any wildlife. When should I call about a bear? You can call anytime to report sightings, knocked-over garbage cans, or property damage caused by bears. The city collects information about where bears go in the city, and what kinds of attractants draw them there, to help better address human-bear conflicts. Will CPW pay for property damage caused by bears? In some cases, the CPW will reimburse agricultural producers for damage caused by big game, including bears, to their agricultural product or means of production. The reimbursement process is governed by state statutes and regulations and does not apply to personal property, including fences, garages, cars, or most other objects that a bear might damage within the Boulder city limits.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How many parking tickets do I have to get before my vehicle can be towed? A vehicle can be towed if one or more parking tickets remain unpaid. Boulder Revised Code Section 2-6-7 authorizes the court clerk to order the impoundment of vehicles that have been placed on the scofflaw (\"pick-up\") list if the registered owner fails to pay or respond to a letter notifying the owner that the vehicle has unpaid parking tickets. What should I do if my vehicle has been towed? If your vehicle has been impounded due to outstanding parking tickets, call the Boulder Police Department at 303-441-3333 to locate your vehicle. To obtain a release of your vehicle, you must Contact the Boulder Municipal Court to pay the balance owed. You can also make your payment at the Boulder Police Department, located at 1805 33rd Street. The Police Department is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., seven days a week. After hours, call dispatch at 303-441-3333 for a City of Boulder impound or 303-441-4444 if your car was located in Boulder County. Payments may be made in cash only. Why was I towed if I don't have any unpaid parking tickets? There are two possible reasons: occasionally, a vehicle is towed because it is blocking a private driveway and the residents have asked the Police Department to remove the vehicle. during certain time periods, construction or city street sweeping projects will result in the towing of a vehicle. Signs posted prior to the initiation of construction or street sweeping projects authorize towing of vehicles parked in locations designated as temporary \"No Parking\" zones. If your vehicle is not located where you originally parked, first check nearby to see if the vehicle was simply moved to another location. If you are still unable to locate your vehicle, contact the Boulder Police Department. at 303-441-3333. Why do I have to pay a scofflaw fee and an impound fee? The court is authorized to impose a \"scofflaw\" fee to offset its administrative costs in placing a vehicle on the \"scofflaw\" or \"pick-up\" list. These costs include obtaining current address information for the registered owner, and generating and mailing the required scofflaw notice to the registered owner. The impound fee is designed to offset the time spent by police officers and court staff associated with the towing of your vehicle. Why do I have to to pay an impound fee to both the court and the tow company? The city incurs expenses associated with the impound and towing of your vehicle, including police officer and staff time. Boulder Revised Code Section 2-6-7 authorizes the court to pass along these costs to the owner of the vehicle. The towing company also incurs expenses in towing the vehicle to the tow yard, and is authorized by its contract with the city to pass that cost along to the registered owner of the vehicle. I cannot pay the entire balance of my overdue fines. Can I get a payment plan? The court does not accept payment plans for parking fines. You must pay the entire balance before the court will issue a release for the towed vehicle. If your vehicle has not been towed but you are on the \"pick-up\" list, you may pay less than the full balance owed, but you will remain on the \"pick-up\" list and can be towed until the balance has been paid in full. Why was a boot placed on my vehicle? If your vehicle was booted, it is because you have unpaid parking tickets. During normal business days and hours, you can call the court at 303-441-4212 to pay your tickets and arrange to have the boot removed. At other times, you can call the police at 303-441-3333 to pay your tickets and arrange to have the boot removed. If payment is not made by the end of the day that the boot is placed on a vehicle, the vehicle will be towed. It is also possible that the boot was placed on your vehicle by a private company. This may occur when a vehicle is parked on private property without a legal right to do so, or when it has exceeded the number of hours that parking on that property is permitted. Usually, signs are posted on the property indicating the number to call when a vehicle has been immobilized by a boot.</td>\n",

Who owns the railroad tracks in Boulder? Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway owns and operates all railroad tracks in the City of Boulder. Who controls the railroad crossings in the Boulder area? There are ten crossings in the immediate vicinity of Boulder. Five are on roads controlled by the city and five are on county-controlled roads. Therefore, the city and county are coordinating to establish quiet zones in the Boulder area, as federal rules stipulate that the agency that controls the road at the crossing must apply for Quiet Zone status. ﻿Who regulates the sounding of train horns at railroad crossings? The sounding of train horns at crossings is regulated by federal rules from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). ﻿Why has train noise increased in recent years? We understand that train horn noise has increased over the past decade, despite the number of trains passing through our community remaining fairly stable. This is due to federal rules, which were adopted in 2005, mandating a consistent pattern and decibel level of horn sounding at public at-grade crossings. Previously, locomotive engineers had more discretion as to when the train horn was sounded, and could, for example, choose not to sound the train horn at a given crossings at night if no hazards were present on the tracks. The federal rules now require that all trains sound horns between 96 and 110 decibels at all public crossings. However, in the same 2005 rulemaking process, the FRA established a process by which road authorities can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horns at crossings. Information concerning quiet zones is available at http://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889.  ﻿What can legally be done to decrease train noise at crossings? The same 2005 FRA rules that governed the blowing of horns also established a process by which local governments can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horn at all crossings. Information on the use of locomotive horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings can be found on the FRA website. ﻿How are quiet zones established? Crossings considered for Quiet Zone establishment are evaluated by a diagnostic team consisting of the road authority who owns and maintains the roadway, the railroad operating over the crossing, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, and the Colorado Department of Transportation. There are several crossing improvement treatments that are pre-approved by the FRA called Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs). These improvements can include a combination of features such as railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and construction of raised medians. Each crossing is evaluated to determine which treatments are needed at the crossing. Crossings treated with SSMs require only a notification to the FRA for Quiet Zone establishment. The cost for these installations is higher, but use of SSM treatments results in a permanent Quiet Zone. Another option for Quiet Zone establishment is through the use of Alternative Safety Measures (ASMs). These are typically non-engineering solutions such as photo enforcement. This option requires an application to the FRA along with documentation to support the selected treatment. Once applied for, the FRA will evaluate the treatment and approve or deny the application. Approval of ASM alternatives includes stipulations regarding enforcement, monitoring and reporting to the FRA on a regular basis. If any incidents occur, or the stipulations are not met, the Quiet Zone designation can be revoked. ﻿What is the cost of establishing a quiet zone? The diagnostic review at each crossing helps the team determine what infrastructure is currently in place, and what, if any additional installations are necessary to meet the requirements of one of the SSM treatments. Addition of gates, flashers, bells, and railroad circuitry can cost $350,000. Crossings that already have the railroad equipment may only need the construction of raised medians, which can be done for under $50,000 per crossing. The cost is based on what crossing warning devices and roadway features exist at the crossing when it is evaluated for consideration of Quiet Zone establishment. There is no readily available documentation of costs for Quiet Zone establishment using ASMs. While the infrastructure cost may be lower than an SSM treatment, the cost of enforcement, monitoring and reporting over a longer period of time may result in expenditures relatively comparable to the SSM treatment. ﻿How difficult is it to establish a \"quiet zone? Colorado is home to 10 Quiet Zones in 6 different communities. The process involves a cooperative effort between the road authority, railroad, and agencies with jurisdiction over crossing and roadway safety (Colorado Public Utilities Commission and Colorado Department of Transportation). Use of SSM treatments, while more costly, result in a shorter timeline to Quiet Zone establishment because the SSM treatments have been tested and approved by the FRA. Crossings with much of the equipment already present can be established as Quiet Zones in less than one year. Crossings requiring a greater amount of equipment installation or roadway construction can be established as Quiet Zones in 18 months to three years. However, implementation estimates assume funding sources that are already identified. The City of Boulder received $1.2 million from the Denver Regional Council of Governments for quiet zone design and construction. The city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page has the latest information on this project. ﻿In the case of an accident at a railroad crossing, who is liable? The first Quiet Zone in Colorado was established in Commerce City in 2007. The crossings involved were treated with SSMs, which result in warning devices at the crossings to make the crossings safer. There have been no incidents at these crossings since Quiet Zone establishment, even though trains are not sounding their horns. The FRA has indicated that the courts will ultimately determine who will be held liable if a collision occurs at a grade crossing located within a Quiet Zone, as the collision may have been caused by factors other than the absence of an audible warning. The Final Rule is intended to remove \"failure to sound the locomotive horn\" as a cause of action in lawsuits involving collisions at grade crossings located within Quiet Zones. Therefore, FRA expects that the courts will determine liability issues based on the facts of each case, the FRA's regulatory intent and the nature of this rule and its Federal requirements. ﻿Do quiet zones increase the likelihood of accidents at railroad crossings? Crossings treated with SSMs, which can include a combination of railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and raised medians, are treated with engineered solutions that provide visual, audible and physical warning at a grade crossing that a train is approaching. These crossings are, by default, safer crossings, as they have more infrastructure and warning devices that discourage, and in some cases, physically prohibit a motorist from entering the tracks during approach of a train. Accidents at crossings treated with SSMs have no more likelihood of occurring than at standard crossings you may see that have approach railroad gates that descend when activated by an approaching train. Crossings treated with ASM solutions, which include non-engineered options, may not have any additional warning devices installed as part of the treatment, but also no longer have train horns sounding. There are currently no Quiet Zones that have been successfully established with non-engineered solutions. Therefore, there are no statistics to support a higher rate of accidents at this time. ﻿Are quiet zones really quiet? Experts estimate that 90 percent of train noise comes from blowing the horns, so quiet zones can make a significant difference. Other noise comes from the engines and from train wheels, particularly on curved sections of track. A variety of infrastructure improvements can be used at quiet zones. Some communities have chosen to replace the train-mounted horns with horns mounted on the poles at the crossings. The pole-mounted horns are more directional (aimed down at the railway), which can reduce the number of homes and businesses impacted by the noise. Whether or not these pole-mounted horns are appropriate for some Boulder crossings is being explored by staff. ﻿What is the city currently doing about quiet zones?  City staff has been following this issue for many years and working with the regional partners including Boulder County, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Regional Transportation District (RTD), neighboring communities, and the BNSF, FRA and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. The city commissioned a Railroad Quiet Zone study to refine cost estimates for implementing quiet zones at the BNSF railroad crossings in and near the City of Boulder (this includes several crossings located in Boulder County). This work also provides a clearer picture of the actual needs at individual railroad crossings as well as necessary potential education and enforcement programs. The city conducted a public engagement process with the community to inform a prioritization and phasing plan for implementation. Projects have been prioritized as follows:  47th StreetValmont RoadPearl Parkway63rd Street at the Diagonal Highway55th Street north of Arapahoe Avenue63rd Street north of Arapahoe AvenuePrevious discussions with RTD with regard to the Northwest Rail line can be found in the Guidelines for City of Boulder Participation in the Northwest Rail Environmental Evaluation.What is RTD's involvement in helping to establish quiet zones?  City staff has also been following this issue for many years and working with the Regional Transportation Division (RTD) and other partners to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. RTD is planning to construct quiet zone improvements along much of the Northwest (NW) Rail corridor if it is built, which is currently estimated for 2030 and beyond. The city continues to work with RTD and other agency partners to bring rail and its associate improvements to the corridor within a more reasonable timeline than currently proposed.Contact For more information, please contact Noreen Walsh, Senior Transportation Planner, at 303-441-3200 or view the City of Boulder Quiet Zones informational brochure.</td>\n",

Trash, Recyclables and Compostables 6-3 The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the accumulation and storage of trash, recyclables and compostables; and to prevent conditions that may create fire, health or other safety hazards; harbor pests; or impair the aesthetic appearance of neighborhoods. The provisions of this chapter are intended to help ensure that trash, recyclables and compostables are disposed of in an appropriate and timely manner, that such materials are properly screened and to support waste reduction programs that promote recycling and composting. What can I do to prevent my trash from being scattered?  It is your responsibility to ensure that bears, raccoons, dogs, and wind can not scatter trash. For this reason trash can not be stored in plastic bags in alleyways and containers must be keep secured. Residents may choose to store their containers in a garage or shed, behind a fence, and can also opt for bear resistant container to secure trash from being scattered.   What constitutes a violation of accumulation of trash?  Generally storage of items not desinged or intended for outdoor use could constitute a violation. Items may include but are not limited to mattresses; discarded furniture and appliances; car parts and tires; wood pallets; and piled yard and food waste. However every property and situation is unique and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. When can I put my trash cans out and when do I have to bring them in?  Place trash, recycling or composting containers in a front yard setback or in the public right-of-way, excepting public alleys, no earlier than 5 a.m. on the scheduled collection day. Remove all containers from those locations by 9 p.m. the same collection day. What can I do with my branch piles?   Branch piles can pose a hazard by harboring rodents and could be a fire risk. Boulder residents may use the Yard Waste Drop-off services to remove branch piles.</td>\n",

Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines.

Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you.

The city manager may grant such exemptions according to the following standards. A person applying for an exemption must demonstrate economic need by certifying eligibility for energy assistance according to economic guidelines established by the United States Office of Management and Budget under the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP), as administered by Boulder County. A person applying for an exemption must sign a verified affidavit demonstrating reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. An exemption obtained under this section shall be effective for one year from the date it is granted. A power outage, interruption of natural gas supply, or temporary equipment failure existed at the time and location of the violation that did not result from any action of the person charged with the violation. The burning occurred in a EPA-certified wood stove or in a solid fuel burning device that meets the same emission standards as are required for a Phase III-certified wood stove and is tested by an EPA-accredited laboratory.

       "0    The City of Boulder is committed to making housing in our community available to a variety of people, including those who could not otherwise purchase a home in Boulder's housing market. The Division of Housing offers opportunities for homeownership to those with low and moderate incomes - from down payment assistance on market rate homes to homes that must be sold at affordable prices. How long does it take to become income-certified? Generally up to two weeks. Who needs to be on the application? Everyone who lives in the household or is part of the household, in addition to all people who will be listed on the property title. Household members should include all individuals: legal spouse, domestic partner, or common-law spouse; children(under 18 who reside with the applicant at least 50 percent of the time; and/or a significant other whom the applicant chooses to include as a member of his/her household, who will be occupying the house. The applicant's spouse must be included unless they are legally divorced or separated. Persons not counted include foster children, unborn children, and children under 18 who reside with the applicant less then 50 percent of the time. How is annual income calculated? Annual income is defined as the anticipated total income for the next 12-month period received from all sources by each member (over the age of 18) of the household. It is assumed that today's circumstances will continue for the next 12 months. The applicant is required to verify this by either submitting a letter from his/her employer stating his/her annual wage or by completing an employer verification form. To obtain this form, call the Housing Division at 303-441-3157 ext. 2. How is income verified for self-employed people? Self-employed individuals should submit copies of their last three years of federal income-tax forms and must also submit an up-to-date profit/loss statement. How are assets calculated? Assets are calculated based on annual income earned (interest), not the value of the asset itself. Can I combine any programs? Neither First Home (20 percent down payment) nor the House to Home (15 percent down payment) Assistance Programs can be combined with a HomeWorks (permanently affordable) Home, since these homes have already been subsidized by the City of Boulder or the developer. The 3 percent solution may be used with HomeWorks. Can I have a cosigner? Yes, a non-occupying cosigner will not be included in the household. However, if the cosigner's name appears on the title, her/his income must be included in the income certification application. Do I have to be a first-time home buyer? To qualify for the down payment assistance programs, you must be a first-time home buyer, which means you have not owned a home in the last three years unless you have been divorced (in the last three years) or are a displaced homemaker. You do not have to be a first-time home buyer to purchase an Affordable Home. Do I have to purchase in the city limits of Boulder? Yes. Find out if the property is located in the Boulder City Limits. How are improvements calculated for Affordable Homes? The low-income covenant lists all of the pre-approved capital improvements. The home owner should contact the city before the improvement has begun in order to ensure how the improvement will be calculated into the resale price. Homeowners are allowed to add a maximum of $25,000 to the resale calculation for pre-approved capital improvements.

       "7    The Open Space and Mountain Parks (OSMP) Department provides a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities for people of all abilities. Many trails, parking areas, shelters and facilities on OSMP already meet accessibility guidelines established by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Others are retrofitted each year as resources allow. ADA guidelines are included in the design of new structures, trails and facilities.

If a dog is causing a nuisance and disturbing your peace, there are some steps you can follow to help resolve the issue. The first step to take is to try and talk with your neighbor. Many people are unaware that their dog barks when they are absent. They may not be aware that their dog's barking is bothering you. Speaking with the dog guardian often solves the problem. If you are uncomfortable speaking with your neighbor, a polite note placed on the front door or mailed to the address can help make them aware of the problem. While the city does recommend trying to solve the dispute with your neighbor to reach an amiable solution on your own, speaking with your neighbor is a suggestion and not a requirement when dealing with barking dogs. If attempting to address the barking dog problem on your own fails, call the Boulder Police Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report the problem. Be prepared to provide Animal Protection with the following information: the address of the barking dog; exact date(s) and time(s) of the barking, preferably the most recent occurrence; and a description of the dog(s), if you can provide one. The City of Boulder has a two-step process when dealing with nuisance dogs. Once you have provided the necessary information, Boulder Police Animal Protection will contact the dog's guardian and issue a written warning. Animal Protection will meet with the guardian in person to help them identify what is causing the barking and try to find a solution. In accordance with city ordinance, a written warning must be issued prior to a summons being served. After the warning is issued, give the guardian 10 to 14 days to identify the cause and possible resolutions to the nuisance barking. Many times, guardians need to utilize trial and error to discover which bark-control methods work best for their dog If the written warning is not successful and additional enforcement action must be taken, two reporting parties are required for a court summons to be issued. The reporting parties will need to complete witness statements for the same date/time/duration for a court summons to be issued. Why do dogs bark?

       "9    Animal Protection Please contact Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint. Boulder Animal Protection is a division of the Boulder Police Department that enforces all city ordinances related to animals and state laws related to domestic animals. Animal Protection responds to animal-related complaints and promotes responsible pet ownership through enforcement, mediation and education. Officers investigate and respond to: roaming dogs; dangerous or aggressive animals; animal bites; cruelty and/or neglect to animals; animal noise (barking dogs); excess animal feces; leash law and tethering violations; dog licensing violations; and injured and orphaned small wildlife. Animal Rules and RegulationsThe City of Boulder's animal laws were developed to ensure the health and safety of residents and their pets. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. Leash lawAll dogs in the City of Boulder must be kept on leashes at all times unless they are confined to their owner's property. Dogs that roam loose present a danger to the community and may be hit by a car or attacked by other animals. An exception for your dog to run free is to utilize one of the designated off-leash dog parks. If you have obtained an Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag for your dog, you must utilize the designated opens space areas that are participating in that program. Rabies vaccinationCity of Boulder law requires all dogs and cats over the age of four months to be vaccinated against rabies. After the initial vaccination, animals must be kept current on rabies vaccinations using either a one-year or three-year vaccination. All vaccinations must be provided by a Colorado-licensed veterinarian. City of Boulder dog licenseA City of Boulder dog license is required for all dogs over the age of four months living within the city limits. The license serves as identification to enable officers to contact you if your dog is lost or injured, and to ensure that your dog is currently vaccinated against rabies. The license must be obtained within 30 days of acquiring the dog or within 30 days of moving to Boulder. In order to purchase a city dog license, a guardian must provide proof of a current rabies vaccination. All dogs are required to wear their City of Boulder dog license tag on their collar or harness at all times. Keep in mind that the Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag is not a substitute for a city dog license. Aggressive animalsNo person shall own or keep any aggressive animal. An aggressive animal is one that approaches a person in a vicious or terrorizing attitude of attack. An animal that bites, claws, or attempts to bite or claw any person, or bites or injures another animal, will be considered a vicious animal. Be sure to keep your pets under control at all times to prevent an incident such as an attack or bite. Animal cruelty or neglectAll animals in Boulder are legally protected from being abandoned, beaten, tortured, injured, transported in an unsafe manner, or killed. Failure to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, grooming, opportunity for exercise, or sanitary conditions is a violation of city ordinance. Violators will be strictly prosecuted for these infractions. Barking dog nuisance Boulder's animal noise ordinance states that it is unlawful for an owner to allow an animal to disturb the peace with loud and habitual barking, howling, whining, or baying. If you notice that your dog barks unnecessarily, it is your responsibility to identify the problem and resolve it immediately to prevent a disturbance to your neighborhood. Clean up after your animalPicking up your pet's waste is required by city ordinance. It is an important way to help preserve our environment and prevent the spread of disease. Please be courteous to other Boulder community members by cleaning up after your pet. CatsWhile not subject to leash and licensing laws, cats must be vaccinated against rabies beginning at four months of age. Cats must also be restrained from creating a nuisance by leaving feces or damaging the property of another. If a cat is causing a nuisance by defecating or destroying property, a property owner has the legal right to remove the cat from their property and bring it to the local animal shelter. The guardian may also be charged with owning a nuisance cat. Impound and board fees apply to impounded cats. Strict liability Boulder animal laws are strict liability laws. Therefore, an animal's guardian is liable even when there is no proof of negligence or intent. The guardian is responsible for their animal's actions, regardless of the circumstances, accidental or otherwise. If an animal injures, kills, or damages any person, other animal, or property, the strict liability law holds the guardian or keeper of the animal legally responsible, and includes all costs and damages incurred. PenaltiesIn addition to impoundment fees, guardians are subject to a court summons for violations of the city animal ordinances. The maximum penalty for each violation is $1,000 and/or 90 days in jail. Fines are subject to increase for subsequent violations.

       "13   Backflow is the undesired, reversed flow of water in water lines that can contaminate drinking water. The City of Boulder controls water quality up to the point of a private property. After this point, water quality can be degraded or contaminated within a private property. When backflow occurs, water from inside a private property can be pushed or pulled back into the community's drinking water supply.

       "14   Please call Code Enforcement at 303-441-1875 to ask questions or report a code violation.  Service requests submitted online will receive a response within four business days (7:00 am - 5:00 pm, except holidays). Bear Resistant Container Required 6-3-12 - LIMITED WARNINGS will be issued for this violation. The purpose of this chapter is to protect native wildife and the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the secure storage of trash and compost materials from being accessible to bears and other wildlife. Visit boulderwildlifeplan.net for additional information. Am I required to have a bear-resistant container?  If so, by when? Residents living in the Secure Trash Regulation Zone are required to have and properly use bear-resistant containers for compost and trash by June 15, 2016. Bear Continers and dumpsters need to be latched at all times. Click here for video on how to use the Western Disposal bear containers and dumpsters.Does the new ordinance only apply to trash and compost, or does it also apply to recycling?    Ordinance No. 7962 requires trash and compost to be secured at all times in a bear-resistant cart, dumpster, or enclosure. Recycling is excluded from the requirements of the ordinance. Residents are also required  to store all waste and recycle containers so that the contents are not scattered by animals, wind, or other elements.  My compost and trash containers are stored in my garage at all times except when placed at the curb on the morning of waste collection. Do I still need a bear-resistant cart? Yes, trash and compost containers need to be secure at all times until collected by a waste hauler. If you put your containers outside at any time (even just before pick-up on the morning of collection), the carts or containers must be bear-resistant. Can I still bag my leaves and grass for pick-up?  Yes, landscape material can be bagged in paper lawn and leaf bags. However, do not add any food waste or other attractants to yard waste to prevent it from being scattered. Any scattered items are still subject to possible enforcement. If I want to build an outdoor enclosure for my compost and trash carts, will I need a building permit?  If so, are there any exemptions from other city regulatory procedures?   Bear Resistant enclosures that are fixed in-place and designed to shelter or protect any kind of property are required to satisfy all applicable codes and regulations, including (but not limited to) minimum setbacks, building separation, maximum building coverage, site triangles, etc. In most residential zoning districts, some types of outdoor enclosures may contribute to the property's maximum allowed floor area ratio (FAR) if the floor-to-ceiling height within the enclosure is greater than six feet. Contact Planning and Development Services at 303-441-1880 or plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to discuss the specifications of your proposed enclosure with a Project Specialist so they can provide information specific to your property. Project Specialists are generally available for walk-in consultations during P&DS business hours. Can I develop my own securing system to make my trash and compost carts \"bear-resistant\"?  I have a system that works well and have never had a problem with bears.No. The city's \"bear-resistant\" standard includes specific minimum requirements in the Rule Establishing Requirements for Bear-Resistant Containers, Dumpsters and Enclosures. Examples of Bear-resistant Carts That Meet the Ordinance Requirements BearSaver Grizzly Poly Cart models (PC32-G, PC65-G, and PC95-G) Bearicuda Basic, Classic, and Stealth models (PAK130, PAK132, PAK164, PAK195, STL135, STL264, and STL296)I received a citation, how do I pay a citation?

       "15   Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) has provided this list of frequently asked questions about bear management in the City of Boulder. The CPW is responsible for the direct management of all wildlife in the state. For more information, visit the Living with Bears in Colorado webpage. Why are there bears in Boulder? The land surrounding Boulder, including Open Space and Mountain Parks, U.S. Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties, and the mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for bears. Bears find food in the form of garbage, compost, bird seed, barbecue grills, pet food, and fruit from trees. There is an abundance of water from various creeks, ditches, wetlands and backyard water features (fountains and ponds). Bear sightings are most common west of Broadway, but it is not uncommon for bears to be seen in the east part of Boulder. Do we have grizzly bears in Colorado? No, all bears in Colorado are black bears, regardless of whether the coat is black, brown, blond or cinnamon-colored. The last confirmed grizzly bear in Colorado was seen in 1979. Why can't CPW take all of the bears out of town and keep them out? There is no simple way to keep bears out of the city. Because abundant, high-quality habitat exists around the City of Boulder, there will always be bears in town to some extent. In some cases, bears in Boulder may be relocated, though this often is not an ideal solution. Young bears may be somewhat more likely to stay in the area they are moved to. There are, as of yet, no proven techniques to exclude bears from large areas like Boulder, though minimizing human attractants and food sources does help. What is the two strike policy, and what does it mean if a bear is ear-tagged? The CPW has a \"two-strike\" policy under which bears may be tranquilized, ear-tagged and relocated once if they are in an inappropriate location (for example, too far into town), or they have engaged in episode(s) of \"nuisance\" behavior (multiple visits to town, light property damage, etc.). If that same bear has to be physically dealt with again (tranquilized or trapped due to inappropriate location or nuisance behavior), the bear is put down. Bears that pose a public safety risk will be put down regardless of whether they have ear tags or not. What does CPW do about bears in town?  When are they relocated or killed? The response from CPW will depend on a variety of factors such as location, time of day, history of the bear in town, whether the bear is already ear-tagged, and current behavior. In these cases, the CPW will educate the neighborhood about bear attractants, often via media releases, volunteers going door-to-door and posting signs. Hazing of bears in Boulder (using air horns, banging pots and pans, yelling) is also encouraged in order to make the bear feel uncomfortable around humans. If the bear is in a location where it can be left unbothered, the CPW will often notify immediate neighbors and leave it alone, or leave it with a city or CPW \"bear-sitter\" who can keep an eye on the bear and notify neighbors when the bear moves. That bear will often move back onto open space on its own, usually after dark. Capturing the bear is a last resort, and will only be attempted if less-intensive management options are not effective or appropriate. If the bear has not been captured before, it will be ear-tagged and relocated. If the bear is already ear-tagged, it will be put down. Bears considered to be a public safety risk will not be relocated, but will be put down regardless of whether they are ear-tagged or not. What can I do to keep myself, my kids and my pets safe? Educate yourself and everyone in your house about bears about how to reduce attractants on your property and in your neighborhood. A great place to start is the Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) website. The CPW recommends that children be supervised when outside in bear, mountain lion and coyote habitat. The risk of injury or death to humans, including children, from bears, is low. Teach your children to be aware of wildlife and what to do if they encounter wildlife. An easy acronym to remember is SMART: S - Stop, do not run. M - Make yourself look big. A - Announce \"Leave me alone!\" R - Retreat - back away slowly. T - Tell an adult. Practicing scenarios ahead of time can better prepare children for an unexpected encounter with wildlife, including bears. Bears do not usually bother pets or target them as food items, and are often afraid of dogs. How can I reduce the chance of a bear coming onto or near my property? Containing food items and other smelly attractants is the best way to reduce the chances that bears will show interest in your property. When bears successfully seek out human food sources, it increases the chances they will repeatedly come into the City of Boulder to forage. Garbage and compost should be kept in a shed or garage until the morning of pickup, or kept in a bear-resistant trash container so that the bear will not be able to access the food items. Birdfeeders should either be removed from April through November or hung in such a manner that prevents bears from accessing it. Pet food should not be left outside and should be removed as soon as your pet has finished eating. Barbeque grills should be stored in a garage or cleaned thoroughly after each use. The fruit trees that grow in many parts of Boulder can serve as an attractant to bears from mid-summer into the fall. CPW recommends that residents pick up fallen fruit on a regular basis and reconsider planting new fruit trees. Residents can also pick fruit on trees to further minimize attractants. Backyard ponds can serve as an attractant to bears, particularly in the warmer months. Residents concerned about bears near their property should consider draining these ponds. Reducing bear attractants is a community effort, and talking with your neighbors about the importance of keeping attractants contained will benefit both people and bears. When are bears most active?  Is it unusual to see a bear in the middle of the day? Bears are generally most active at dusk, throughout the night, and into the dawn hours. This is often when they are foraging and moving around. However, it is not unusual or abnormal to see bears in the middle of the day. In the fall months, bears need to feed up to 20 hours a day to prepare for hibernation. Hibernation dates can vary depending on the weather, available food sources, and the individual bear, but bears generally will enter hibernation in mid-late November and emerge in early-mid April. What do bears eat? Bears are omnivorous and eat a wide variety of plant and animal materials. Potential food sources include garbage, compost, bird seed, food from barbecue grills, pet food left outside, and fruit from trees. Bears are frequent visitors because all of these attractants exist within Boulder. Why can't we feed bears to keep them out of town? CPW does not feed bears outside of Boulder during difficult years because it does not solve the problem of bears coming into town and doing so is bad for the bears. Natural food is difficult, but it is not impossible, to find. Feeding bears reduces their motivation and ability to find food, which may cause bears to become dependent on artificial feeding stations for survival. A single habitat can only support a certain number of bears in a given year. If the CPW were to artificially increase the availability of food for bears around Boulder by feeding them, it would artificially increase local bear populations through a higher breeding success rate and lower mortality. What are the risks to humans from bears? During the last several decades, there have been three fatalities and 37 incidents in which a person was injured by a black bear in Colorado. Many of these incidents involved the bear either being intentionally fed or being unintentionally habituated to people. There are many things you can do to lower the risk of injury from bears, including removing any attractants around your home and staying alert and aware when you are in any forest, park, or open space area. What is considered aggressive bear behavior? Many times what appears to be aggressive behavior of bears is more likely defensive behavior. When they feel threatened, defensive bears will: \"pop\" their jaws; make low moaning sounds; \"huff\" or exhale quickly to try to demonstrate that they are \"tough and strong;\" and/or \"false charge\" by running at the threat but stopping before they reach it. Aggressive behavior is rare in black bears. Examples of aggressive behavior would be if a bear, despite having easy ways to escape, approached people or if a bear entered a tent and injured someone. Who should I call when I see a bear? For general bear information, including advice for living with bears, call Colorado Parks and Wildlife at 303-291-7227 or visit the Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) website. To report sightings within the City of Boulder, call the: Boulder Police non-emergency number at 303-441-3333; or Colorado Parks and Wildlife (during business hours) at 303-291-7227. Call 911 in the event of an immediate human safety issue, or if a human or pet is injured by any wildlife. When should I call about a bear? You can call anytime to report sightings, knocked-over garbage cans, or property damage caused by bears. The city collects information about where bears go in the city, and what kinds of attractants draw them there, to help better address human-bear conflicts. Will CPW pay for property damage caused by bears? In some cases, the CPW will reimburse agricultural producers for damage caused by big game, including bears, to their agricultural product or means of production. The reimbursement process is governed by state statutes and regulations and does not apply to personal property, including fences, garages, cars, or most other objects that a bear might damage within the Boulder city limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Instead, please use one of the following links:Multi-Use Path MaintenanceStreet Maintenance (this include on-street bike lanes)Street Sweeping (this include on-street bike lanes) To submit a close call between a bike, pedestrian or motorist, please go to that topic.  The City of Boulder maintains almost 80 total miles of on-street bike lanes. The city's transportation maintenance department performs routine, year-round maintenance of bike lanes, with weekly lane sweeping to remove debris. City staff plows most bicycle facilities during and after winter weather events, fixes potholes and removes overhanging vegetation. The city also responds to any reported maintenance issues as needed.  In addition to the network of on-street bike lanes, the city maintains almost 50 total miles of signed and designated bike routes. A signed bicycle route is typically designated along more lightly traveled residential or secondary roads that follow the same general corridor as more heavily trafficked roadways. Choosing routes with minimal traffic hazards is typically part of the process to create a good route.   A map of all bike lanes and routes is available on the city's website by following this link: Bike-Ped System Map.Mapping Your RouteThe GO Bike Boulder route finder will show you how to get anywhere in Boulder by bike.

Is there someone I can report this to? If you actually had an accident where physical contact was made in one form or another, please report that to the Police Department. It's the law to report all transportation accidents and also helps the City identify countermeasures to reduce future collisions and improve transportation safety. For emergencies, dial 911. For non-emergencies, call 303-441-3333.The city tracks close calls to determine if more outreach is necessary in certain areas of the city, at certain types of pedestrian crosswalk treatments or for specific types of conflicts.

       "21   The Boulder Civic Area is a visionary \"community-driven\" project to rethink and evolve the downtown's most expansive public space. In addition to city-owned properties at the core, the planning area is bounded by 9th to 17th streets and Canyon Boulevard to Arapahoe Avenue. The goal of the project is to transform this area into Boulder's social, civic and environmental heart; one that prioritizes purpose per square foot over price per square foot.

       "23   Boulder Measures - Phase One Boulder Measures is the city's online dashboard, and is a tool to share data, measure progress, assist with decision-making, identify areas of opportunity and discuss trends related to both City Council goals and departmental master plans using the Sustainability Framework as the foundation. The dashboard and metrics will be iterative. There will be new data sets and measurements added, as appropriate, and updates to existing data will be made in a timely and consistent way. Phase One provides a starting point to gather input on metrics - those that will be included in the initial launch as well as future metrics the community would like to see - site design, and overall site functionality. The information gathered will inform scoping of Phase Two. We would love to hear your input!

       "224  How many parking tickets do I have to get before my vehicle can be towed? A vehicle can be towed if one or more parking tickets remain unpaid. Boulder Revised Code Section 2-6-7 authorizes the court clerk to order the impoundment of vehicles that have been placed on the scofflaw (\"pick-up\") list if the registered owner fails to pay or respond to a letter notifying the owner that the vehicle has unpaid parking tickets. What should I do if my vehicle has been towed? If your vehicle has been impounded due to outstanding parking tickets, call the Boulder Police Department at 303-441-3333 to locate your vehicle. To obtain a release of your vehicle, you must Contact the Boulder Municipal Court to pay the balance owed. You can also make your payment at the Boulder Police Department, located at 1805 33rd Street. The Police Department is open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., seven days a week. After hours, call dispatch at 303-441-3333 for a City of Boulder impound or 303-441-4444 if your car was located in Boulder County. Payments may be made in cash only. Why was I towed if I don't have any unpaid parking tickets? There are two possible reasons: occasionally, a vehicle is towed because it is blocking a private driveway and the residents have asked the Police Department to remove the vehicle. during certain time periods, construction or city street sweeping projects will result in the towing of a vehicle. Signs posted prior to the initiation of construction or street sweeping projects authorize towing of vehicles parked in locations designated as temporary \"No Parking\" zones. If your vehicle is not located where you originally parked, first check nearby to see if the vehicle was simply moved to another location. If you are still unable to locate your vehicle, contact the Boulder Police Department. at 303-441-3333. Why do I have to pay a scofflaw fee and an impound fee? The court is authorized to impose a \"scofflaw\" fee to offset its administrative costs in placing a vehicle on the \"scofflaw\" or \"pick-up\" list. These costs include obtaining current address information for the registered owner, and generating and mailing the required scofflaw notice to the registered owner. The impound fee is designed to offset the time spent by police officers and court staff associated with the towing of your vehicle. Why do I have to to pay an impound fee to both the court and the tow company? The city incurs expenses associated with the impound and towing of your vehicle, including police officer and staff time. Boulder Revised Code Section 2-6-7 authorizes the court to pass along these costs to the owner of the vehicle. The towing company also incurs expenses in towing the vehicle to the tow yard, and is authorized by its contract with the city to pass that cost along to the registered owner of the vehicle. I cannot pay the entire balance of my overdue fines. Can I get a payment plan? The court does not accept payment plans for parking fines. You must pay the entire balance before the court will issue a release for the towed vehicle. If your vehicle has not been towed but you are on the \"pick-up\" list, you may pay less than the full balance owed, but you will remain on the \"pick-up\" list and can be towed until the balance has been paid in full. Why was a boot placed on my vehicle? If your vehicle was booted, it is because you have unpaid parking tickets. During normal business days and hours, you can call the court at 303-441-4212 to pay your tickets and arrange to have the boot removed. At other times, you can call the police at 303-441-3333 to pay your tickets and arrange to have the boot removed. If payment is not made by the end of the day that the boot is placed on a vehicle, the vehicle will be towed. It is also possible that the boot was placed on your vehicle by a private company. This may occur when a vehicle is parked on private property without a legal right to do so, or when it has exceeded the number of hours that parking on that property is permitted. Usually, signs are posted on the property indicating the number to call when a vehicle has been immobilized by a boot.

       "227  For the Latest Information: You can find the latest information about the city's quiet zones project and how to stay updated by visiting the city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page. Who owns the railroad tracks in Boulder? Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway owns and operates all railroad tracks in the City of Boulder. Who controls the railroad crossings in the Boulder area? There are ten crossings in the immediate vicinity of Boulder. Five are on roads controlled by the city and five are on county-controlled roads. Therefore, the city and county are coordinating to establish quiet zones in the Boulder area, as federal rules stipulate that the agency that controls the road at the crossing must apply for Quiet Zone status. ﻿Who regulates the sounding of train horns at railroad crossings? The sounding of train horns at crossings is regulated by federal rules from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). ﻿Why has train noise increased in recent years? We understand that train horn noise has increased over the past decade, despite the number of trains passing through our community remaining fairly stable. This is due to federal rules, which were adopted in 2005, mandating a consistent pattern and decibel level of horn sounding at public at-grade crossings. Previously, locomotive engineers had more discretion as to when the train horn was sounded, and could, for example, choose not to sound the train horn at a given crossings at night if no hazards were present on the tracks. The federal rules now require that all trains sound horns between 96 and 110 decibels at all public crossings. However, in the same 2005 rulemaking process, the FRA established a process by which road authorities can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horns at crossings. Information concerning quiet zones is available at http://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889.  ﻿What can legally be done to decrease train noise at crossings? The same 2005 FRA rules that governed the blowing of horns also established a process by which local governments can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horn at all crossings. Information on the use of locomotive horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings can be found on the FRA website. ﻿How are quiet zones established? Crossings considered for Quiet Zone establishment are evaluated by a diagnostic team consisting of the road authority who owns and maintains the roadway, the railroad operating over the crossing, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, and the Colorado Department of Transportation. There are several crossing improvement treatments that are pre-approved by the FRA called Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs). These improvements can include a combination of features such as railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and construction of raised medians. Each crossing is evaluated to determine which treatments are needed at the crossing. Crossings treated with SSMs require only a notification to the FRA for Quiet Zone establishment. The cost for these installations is higher, but use of SSM treatments results in a permanent Quiet Zone. Another option for Quiet Zone establishment is through the use of Alternative Safety Measures (ASMs). These are typically non-engineering solutions such as photo enforcement. This option requires an application to the FRA along with documentation to support the selected treatment. Once applied for, the FRA will evaluate the treatment and approve or deny the application. Approval of ASM alternatives includes stipulations regarding enforcement, monitoring and reporting to the FRA on a regular basis. If any incidents occur, or the stipulations are not met, the Quiet Zone designation can be revoked. ﻿What is the cost of establishing a quiet zone? The diagnostic review at each crossing helps the team determine what infrastructure is currently in place, and what, if any additional installations are necessary to meet the requirements of one of the SSM treatments. Addition of gates, flashers, bells, and railroad circuitry can cost $350,000. Crossings that already have the railroad equipment may only need the construction of raised medians, which can be done for under $50,000 per crossing. The cost is based on what crossing warning devices and roadway features exist at the crossing when it is evaluated for consideration of Quiet Zone establishment. There is no readily available documentation of costs for Quiet Zone establishment using ASMs. While the infrastructure cost may be lower than an SSM treatment, the cost of enforcement, monitoring and reporting over a longer period of time may result in expenditures relatively comparable to the SSM treatment. ﻿How difficult is it to establish a \"quiet zone? Colorado is home to 10 Quiet Zones in 6 different communities. The process involves a cooperative effort between the road authority, railroad, and agencies with jurisdiction over crossing and roadway safety (Colorado Public Utilities Commission and Colorado Department of Transportation). Use of SSM treatments, while more costly, result in a shorter timeline to Quiet Zone establishment because the SSM treatments have been tested and approved by the FRA. Crossings with much of the equipment already present can be established as Quiet Zones in less than one year. Crossings requiring a greater amount of equipment installation or roadway construction can be established as Quiet Zones in 18 months to three years. However, implementation estimates assume funding sources that are already identified. The City of Boulder received $1.2 million from the Denver Regional Council of Governments for quiet zone design and construction. The city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page has the latest information on this project. ﻿In the case of an accident at a railroad crossing, who is liable? The first Quiet Zone in Colorado was established in Commerce City in 2007. The crossings involved were treated with SSMs, which result in warning devices at the crossings to make the crossings safer. There have been no incidents at these crossings since Quiet Zone establishment, even though trains are not sounding their horns. The FRA has indicated that the courts will ultimately determine who will be held liable if a collision occurs at a grade crossing located within a Quiet Zone, as the collision may have been caused by factors other than the absence of an audible warning. The Final Rule is intended to remove \"failure to sound the locomotive horn\" as a cause of action in lawsuits involving collisions at grade crossings located within Quiet Zones. Therefore, FRA expects that the courts will determine liability issues based on the facts of each case, the FRA's regulatory intent and the nature of this rule and its Federal requirements. ﻿Do quiet zones increase the likelihood of accidents at railroad crossings? Crossings treated with SSMs, which can include a combination of railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and raised medians, are treated with engineered solutions that provide visual, audible and physical warning at a grade crossing that a train is approaching. These crossings are, by default, safer crossings, as they have more infrastructure and warning devices that discourage, and in some cases, physically prohibit a motorist from entering the tracks during approach of a train. Accidents at crossings treated with SSMs have no more likelihood of occurring than at standard crossings you may see that have approach railroad gates that descend when activated by an approaching train. Crossings treated with ASM solutions, which include non-engineered options, may not have any additional warning devices installed as part of the treatment, but also no longer have train horns sounding. There are currently no Quiet Zones that have been successfully established with non-engineered solutions. Therefore, there are no statistics to support a higher rate of accidents at this time. ﻿Are quiet zones really quiet? Experts estimate that 90 percent of train noise comes from blowing the horns, so quiet zones can make a significant difference. Other noise comes from the engines and from train wheels, particularly on curved sections of track. A variety of infrastructure improvements can be used at quiet zones. Some communities have chosen to replace the train-mounted horns with horns mounted on the poles at the crossings. The pole-mounted horns are more directional (aimed down at the railway), which can reduce the number of homes and businesses impacted by the noise. Whether or not these pole-mounted horns are appropriate for some Boulder crossings is being explored by staff. ﻿What is the city currently doing about quiet zones?  City staff has been following this issue for many years and working with the regional partners including Boulder County, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Regional Transportation District (RTD), neighboring communities, and the BNSF, FRA and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. The city commissioned a Railroad Quiet Zone study to refine cost estimates for implementing quiet zones at the BNSF railroad crossings in and near the City of Boulder (this includes several crossings located in Boulder County). This work also provides a clearer picture of the actual needs at individual railroad crossings as well as necessary potential education and enforcement programs. The city conducted a public engagement process with the community to inform a prioritization and phasing plan for implementation. Projects have been prioritized as follows:  47th StreetValmont RoadPearl Parkway63rd Street at the Diagonal Highway55th Street north of Arapahoe Avenue63rd Street north of Arapahoe AvenuePrevious discussions with RTD with regard to the Northwest Rail line can be found in the Guidelines for City of Boulder Participation in the Northwest Rail Environmental Evaluation.What is RTD's involvement in helping to establish quiet zones?  City staff has also been following this issue for many years and working with the Regional Transportation Division (RTD) and other partners to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. RTD is planning to construct quiet zone improvements along much of the Northwest (NW) Rail corridor if it is built, which is currently estimated for 2030 and beyond. The city continues to work with RTD and other agency partners to bring rail and its associate improvements to the corridor within a more reasonable timeline than currently proposed.Contact For more information, please contact Noreen Walsh, Senior Transportation Planner, at 303-441-3200 or view the City of Boulder Quiet Zones informational brochure.     \n",

Trash, Recyclables and Compostables 6-3 The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the accumulation and storage of trash, recyclables and compostables; and to prevent conditions that may create fire, health or other safety hazards; harbor pests; or impair the aesthetic appearance of neighborhoods. The provisions of this chapter are intended to help ensure that trash, recyclables and compostables are disposed of in an appropriate and timely manner, that such materials are properly screened and to support waste reduction programs that promote recycling and composting. What can I do to prevent my trash from being scattered?  It is your responsibility to ensure that bears, raccoons, dogs, and wind can not scatter trash. For this reason trash can not be stored in plastic bags in alleyways and containers must be keep secured. Residents may choose to store their containers in a garage or shed, behind a fence, and can also opt for bear resistant container to secure trash from being scattered.   What constitutes a violation of accumulation of trash?  Generally storage of items not desinged or intended for outdoor use could constitute a violation. Items may include but are not limited to mattresses; discarded furniture and appliances; car parts and tires; wood pallets; and piled yard and food waste. However every property and situation is unique and is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. When can I put my trash cans out and when do I have to bring them in?  Place trash, recycling or composting containers in a front yard setback or in the public right-of-way, excepting public alleys, no earlier than 5 a.m. on the scheduled collection day. Remove all containers from those locations by 9 p.m. the same collection day. What can I do with my branch piles?   Branch piles can pose a hazard by harboring rodents and could be a fire risk. Boulder residents may use the Yard Waste Drop-off services to remove branch piles.

       "232  The city does not pick up tree branches. However, there are several ongoing options for managing your yard waste: Residents may place any yard debris, along with food waste, for free in their curbside compost collection cart. As part of the regular compost collection, on each regularly-scheduled collection day, all haulers are required by law to also pick up (for free): Three extra bags of leaves placed outside the compost cart - AND Three additional bundles of branches - six feet long by three feet wide. If there is more than one branch in the bundle, it must be tied with non-plastic twine so it can be picked up by the collection crews and can be composted.   Residents can bring – or have someone else bring – leaves, branches and untreated, unpainted wood waste to the yard waste and wood waste drop-off center: Located at Western Disposal’s transfer station: 5880 Butte Mill Road Hours 7 AM- 5 PM Monday through Saturday Fees are approximately $6-$10 per car or truck load   Many landscapers and independent individuals with vehicles are often willing to pick up the branches and transport them to the drop-off center for you. Some residents have reported that Craigslist and Nextdoor are good places to seek low-cost hauling services. Thank you for your inquiry.

       "238  The City of Boulder's Failure to Pay Wages Due ordinance prohibits non-payment of wages or compensation by an employer that has a duty to pay those wages or compensation. Failure to pay wages cases are handled by the city's Office of Human Rights. Most cases are resolved through facilitation or mediation. Cases that are not resolved may be prosecuted in the Boulder Municipal Court. If you believe that your employer may be in violation of this ordinance, please contact Community Relations and Office of Human Rights at 303-441-3140.

       "240  Water Being Pumped or Diverted from One Private Property onto Another The City of Boulder does not regulate the discharge or diversion of water from one private property onto another private property. If you believe you have suffered damages or other impacts to your private property due to the activities of neighboring property owners diverting or discharging water, you may wish to consult with a private attorney to explore your legal rights. The city cannot provide legal advice to people who believe they have suffered damages due to an adjacent or nearby property owner diverting water onto a neighbor's property. If any fence, wall or berm was (or is) being constructed to divert drainage without a building permit, contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to alert an inspector of the possible violation.Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off of Private Property onto Public Property like Sidewalks, Streets or GuttersThe City of Boulder regulates the discharge or diversion of water onto public property under the Boulder Revised Code Chapter 8-2-8: Discharging Water Prohibited. Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines. To report water being pumped or diverted onto any public property such as an alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, right-of-way, or street, call 303-441-4237 or \"Make a Service Request\" below.

       "241  Water Seeping into BasementsThe level of groundwater (the depth below ground where the soil is saturated, also called the water table) varies throughout Boulder and some areas have a higher water table than others. Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you. If you can see the source of the water and it's bubbling or spraying up from under the ground or roadway, call 303-441-3200 from 7 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or 303-441-3249 after-hours, to report a water main (pipe) break.

       "242  The city maintains more than 450 miles of water pipe that serve more than 29,000 customers. The water department also maintains and services about 4,700 fire hydrants. All fire hydrant maintenance, including inspections, repairs and painting is managed by Public Works, not the Fire-Rescue Department. The water department also routinely operates valves and flushes fire hydrants to ensure reliable, high-quality, potable water service.  City water customers are advised to know the location of the water shutoff valve inside their home (different from the water meter valve) and how to shut off water in case of an emergency, such as a broken or frozen water pipe. This knowledge can help prevent extensive and expensive damage to your property. The water department's normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.  After-hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as water main breaks.To report an emergency water maintenance issue, including a city water main leak or break, please call 303-441-3200. Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.  Water customers should be aware that after a water main break, tap water may temporarily have a light brown or yellow color. The cause is typically common iron rust from inside the city water pipes.Visit the Drinking Water Quality and Discolored Water Questions page for more information.  The city also offers an interactive web map called the Water Distribution Info. Center that displays locations and live information about planned and unplanned water shutoffs, including main breaks and annual water utility projects.    For all non-emergency water maintenance issues, including fire hydrant and water meter issues, please select the \"Make a Service Request\" button below or call 303-441-3200.

       "248  Please call Code Enforcement at 303-441-1875 to ask questions or report a code violation. Service requests submitted online will receive a response within four business days (7:00 am - 5:00 pm, except holidays). \"No burn\" restrictions are issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. In addition, the Boulder city manager may designate \"no burn\" days when monitoring indicates actual or potential violations of air quality standards established by either the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, or when meteorological conditions warrant such designation. Wood Burning Restrictions 6-9-3(c) Residents may not burn solid fuel devices during a declared \"no burn\" day unless: The person had obtained a temporary exemption demonstrating both an economic need to burn solid fuel for building space heating purposes and a reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. The city manager may grant such exemptions according to the following standards. A person applying for an exemption must demonstrate economic need by certifying eligibility for energy assistance according to economic guidelines established by the United States Office of Management and Budget under the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP), as administered by Boulder County. A person applying for an exemption must sign a verified affidavit demonstrating reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. An exemption obtained under this section shall be effective for one year from the date it is granted. A power outage, interruption of natural gas supply, or temporary equipment failure existed at the time and location of the violation that did not result from any action of the person charged with the violation. The burning occurred in a EPA-certified wood stove or in a solid fuel burning device that meets the same emission standards as are required for a Phase III-certified wood stove and is tested by an EPA-accredited laboratory.
