Please read the back of your ticket carefully and follow the instructions printed on it. If you have any questions, call the Boulder Municipal Court at 303-441-1842. I received a ticket but I don't live in Colorado so I won't be able to appear in court. What can I do?If your ticket is marked as a mail-in ticket, you can follow the instructions on the back of your ticket and mail in the fine. If your ticket is marked as \"not a mail-in,\" you must send a written request to be allowed to plead guilty by mail. Include in your request the ticket number as well as a current address and phone number where you can be reached. Send your request to: City of BoulderCity Attorney's OfficeProsecution DivisionPO Box 8015Boulder, Colorado 80306 When the written request is received, a motion to the court will be made asking the court to allow you to plead guilty by mail and pay a fine. If the motion is approved by the court, you will receive a copy of the motion from the court. You will need to sign the motion and pay the fine by the date noted in the motion. Please note that you may not plea bargain by mail - you may only plead guilty. If you want to try to plea bargain your case, you must appear in court or contact a private attorney to appear in your absence. Can I speak with a prosecuting attorney before I come to court?Are you a defendant, witness or victim? If you are a defendant with a traffic ticket, it is necessary to wait for the court date written on the ticket before speaking to a prosecuting attorney. When you appear in court, you will be advised by the judge of your legal rights. You will then have an opportunity to speak with a prosecuting attorney regarding your case. If you are a witness or a victim, you may call the Prosecution Division of the City Attorney's Office at 303-441-3025. What is an arraignment?An arraignment is the first court appearance for any traffic or other municipal code violation. At this hearing, the Municipal Court judge will hear all cases scheduled for that day's docket. Defendants appearing that day will be advised of their rights and given the opportunity to plead guilty or not guilty and to discuss their cases with a prosecuting attorney or attorney's assistant. A prosecuting attorney will review all traffic tickets before the arraignment date and make a plea bargain offer in writing, where appropriate. At your arraignment, you may accept this offer, enter your plea, and pay the fine and court costs assessed. If you do not wish to accept the plea offer, you may speak with a prosecuting attorney to discuss your case. Please be advised that the pre-screened offer is almost always the best offer that will be made by a prosecuting attorney and may not be changed. Each defendant who has met with a prosecuting attorney or attorney's assistant will then return before the Municipal Court judge and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. Those entering guilty pleas will be assessed court fees and fines, pay for any damages caused by their actions, and their case will be at an end. Those entering not guilty pleas will be assigned another court date for a trial of their case. Do I need to bring an attorney with me to my arraignment?An attorney is generally not needed at an arraignment, although individuals can choose to bring private attorneys with them. What is a disposition (\"dispo\")?A disposition is a final resolution of a case. You must appear in court before the judge. It may include an agreed-upon plea and sentence negotiated between a prosecuting attorney and defendant. All dispositions must be approved by a judge in open court. A disposition date is set by the Municipal Court and can only be changed by the court. Call 303-441-1842 for more information. What is a pretrial conference?A pretrial conference is a meeting between a prosecuting attorney and a defendant and/or defendant's attorney to discuss the case and the possibility of a plea agreement. A pretrial conference can be held on the day of a defendant's arraignment after the court has advised the defendant of their legal rights. If a defendant has an attorney, the attorney can call and schedule a pretrial conference at a time other than the day of arraignment. In some complex cases, a second appointment may be made for a pretrial conference at a later date. I received a waiver of personal service and a subpoena in the mail, what are my options, and who can I call if I have questions about this?The subpoena waiver is mailed to all prosecution witnesses needed to appear at a trial in Boulder Municipal Court. It is important that the signed subpoena waiver be mailed back as soon as possible. You will then be legally required to appear as a witness at trial. If the waiver is signed and returned in the stamped envelope provided, you will not have to be personally served. The name of the defendant and the date and time of the trial are noted in the subpoena waiver. Options Sign and return the subpoena waiver as soon as possible and appear in court on the trial date to testify. Do not sign or return the waiver. If not returned within seven days before trial, a police officer or process server may be sent to your home or business to personally serve your subpoena. Call the Prosecution Division of the City Attorney's Office at 303-441-3025 for more information. I missed my court date. What do I do now? If you missed your arraignment date (first court appearance on a ticket), disposition, or trial, please call the Boulder Municipal Court at 303-441-1842. If you missed a pretrial conference with a prosecuting attorney, please call the Prosecution Division of the City Attorney's Office at 303-441-3025. If you also had a disposition set for the same day and missed it as well, you must first call the court at 303-441-1842.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For the Latest Information: You can find the latest information about the city's quiet zones project and how to stay updated by visiting the city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page. Who owns the railroad tracks in Boulder?Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway owns and operates all railroad tracks in the City of Boulder. Who controls the railroad crossings in the Boulder area?There are ten crossings in the immediate vicinity of Boulder. Five are on roads controlled by the city and five are on county-controlled roads. Therefore, the city and county are coordinating to establish quiet zones in the Boulder area, as federal rules stipulate that the agency that controls the road at the crossing must apply for Quiet Zone status. ﻿Who regulates the sounding of train horns at railroad crossings?The sounding of train horns at crossings is regulated by federal rules from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). ﻿Why has train noise increased in recent years?We understand that train horn noise has increased over the past decade, despite the number of trains passing through our community remaining fairly stable. This is due to federal rules, which were adopted in 2005, mandating a consistent pattern and decibel level of horn sounding at public at-grade crossings. Previously, locomotive engineers had more discretion as to when the train horn was sounded, and could, for example, choose not to sound the train horn at a given crossings at night if no hazards were present on the tracks. The federal rules now require that all trains sound horns between 96 and 110 decibels at all public crossings. However, in the same 2005 rulemaking process, the FRA established a process by which road authorities can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horns at crossings. Information concerning quiet zones is available at http://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889.  ﻿What can legally be done to decrease train noise at crossings?The same 2005 FRA rules that governed the blowing of horns also established a process by which local governments can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horn at all crossings. Information on the use of locomotive horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings can be found on the FRA website. ﻿How are quiet zones established?Crossings considered for Quiet Zone establishment are evaluated by a diagnostic team consisting of the road authority who owns and maintains the roadway, the railroad operating over the crossing, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, and the Colorado Department of Transportation. There are several crossing improvement treatments that are pre-approved by the FRA called Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs). These improvements can include a combination of features such as railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and construction of raised medians. Each crossing is evaluated to determine which treatments are needed at the crossing. Crossings treated with SSMs require only a notification to the FRA for Quiet Zone establishment. The cost for these installations is higher, but use of SSM treatments results in a permanent Quiet Zone. Another option for Quiet Zone establishment is through the use of Alternative Safety Measures (ASMs). These are typically non-engineering solutions such as photo enforcement. This option requires an application to the FRA along with documentation to support the selected treatment. Once applied for, the FRA will evaluate the treatment and approve or deny the application. Approval of ASM alternatives includes stipulations regarding enforcement, monitoring and reporting to the FRA on a regular basis. If any incidents occur, or the stipulations are not met, the Quiet Zone designation can be revoked. ﻿What is the cost of establishing a quiet zone?The diagnostic review at each crossing helps the team determine what infrastructure is currently in place, and what, if any additional installations are necessary to meet the requirements of one of the SSM treatments. Addition of gates, flashers, bells, and railroad circuitry can cost $350,000. Crossings that already have the railroad equipment may only need the construction of raised medians, which can be done for under $50,000 per crossing. The cost is based on what crossing warning devices and roadway features exist at the crossing when it is evaluated for consideration of Quiet Zone establishment. There is no readily available documentation of costs for Quiet Zone establishment using ASMs. While the infrastructure cost may be lower than an SSM treatment, the cost of enforcement, monitoring and reporting over a longer period of time may result in expenditures relatively comparable to the SSM treatment. ﻿How difficult is it to establish a \"quiet zone?Colorado is home to 10 Quiet Zones in 6 different communities. The process involves a cooperative effort between the road authority, railroad, and agencies with jurisdiction over crossing and roadway safety (Colorado Public Utilities Commission and Colorado Department of Transportation). Use of SSM treatments, while more costly, result in a shorter timeline to Quiet Zone establishment because the SSM treatments have been tested and approved by the FRA. Crossings with much of the equipment already present can be established as Quiet Zones in less than one year. Crossings requiring a greater amount of equipment installation or roadway construction can be established as Quiet Zones in 18 months to three years. However, implementation estimates assume funding sources that are already identified. The City of Boulder received $1.2 million from the Denver Regional Council of Governments for quiet zone design and construction. The city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page has the latest information on this project. ﻿In the case of an accident at a railroad crossing, who is liable?The first Quiet Zone in Colorado was established in Commerce City in 2007. The crossings involved were treated with SSMs, which result in warning devices at the crossings to make the crossings safer. There have been no incidents at these crossings since Quiet Zone establishment, even though trains are not sounding their horns. The FRA has indicated that the courts will ultimately determine who will be held liable if a collision occurs at a grade crossing located within a Quiet Zone, as the collision may have been caused by factors other than the absence of an audible warning. The Final Rule is intended to remove \"failure to sound the locomotive horn\" as a cause of action in lawsuits involving collisions at grade crossings located within Quiet Zones. Therefore, FRA expects that the courts will determine liability issues based on the facts of each case, the FRA's regulatory intent and the nature of this rule and its Federal requirements. ﻿Do quiet zones increase the likelihood of accidents at railroad crossings?Crossings treated with SSMs, which can include a combination of railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and raised medians, are treated with engineered solutions that provide visual, audible and physical warning at a grade crossing that a train is approaching. These crossings are, by default, safer crossings, as they have more infrastructure and warning devices that discourage, and in some cases, physically prohibit a motorist from entering the tracks during approach of a train. Accidents at crossings treated with SSMs have no more likelihood of occurring than at standard crossings you may see that have approach railroad gates that descend when activated by an approaching train. Crossings treated with ASM solutions, which include non-engineered options, may not have any additional warning devices installed as part of the treatment, but also no longer have train horns sounding. There are currently no Quiet Zones that have been successfully established with non-engineered solutions. Therefore, there are no statistics to support a higher rate of accidents at this time. ﻿Are quiet zones really quiet?Experts estimate that 90 percent of train noise comes from blowing the horns, so quiet zones can make a significant difference. Other noise comes from the engines and from train wheels, particularly on curved sections of track. A variety of infrastructure improvements can be used at quiet zones. Some communities have chosen to replace the train-mounted horns with horns mounted on the poles at the crossings. The pole-mounted horns are more directional (aimed down at the railway), which can reduce the number of homes and businesses impacted by the noise. Whether or not these pole-mounted horns are appropriate for some Boulder crossings is being explored by staff. ﻿What is the city currently doing about quiet zones? City staff has been following this issue for many years and working with the regional partners including Boulder County, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Regional Transportation District (RTD), neighboring communities, and the BNSF, FRA and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. The city commissioned a Railroad Quiet Zone study to refine cost estimates for implementing quiet zones at the BNSF railroad crossings in and near the City of Boulder (this includes several crossings located in Boulder County). This work also provides a clearer picture of the actual needs at individual railroad crossings as well as necessary potential education and enforcement programs. The city conducted a public engagement process with the community to inform a prioritization and phasing plan for implementation. Projects have been prioritized as follows:  47th StreetValmont RoadPearl Parkway63rd Street at the Diagonal Highway55th Street north of Arapahoe Avenue63rd Street north of Arapahoe AvenuePrevious discussions with RTD with regard to the Northwest Rail line can be found in the Guidelines for City of Boulder Participation in the Northwest Rail Environmental Evaluation.What is RTD's involvement in helping to establish quiet zones? City staff has also been following this issue for many years and working with the Regional Transportation Division (RTD) and other partners to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. RTD is planning to construct quiet zone improvements along much of the Northwest (NW) Rail corridor if it is built, which is currently estimated for 2030 and beyond. The city continues to work with RTD and other agency partners to bring rail and its associate improvements to the corridor within a more reasonable timeline than currently proposed.Contact For more information, please contact Noreen Walsh, Senior Transportation Planner, at 303-441-3200 or view the City of Boulder Quiet Zones informational brochure.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fluoride is a mineral that is naturally found in air, soil, water, plants and foods. Boulder's water sources contain small amounts of natural fluoride. The City of Boulder also adds fluoride to the drinking water to achieve a target level of 0.7 mg/L, which is based on 2015 federal and state guidance. The City of Boulder continues to pay close attention to scientific and regulatory developments and, as always, will comply with all regulatory changes.Why is fluoride added to drinking water?The City of Boulder has added fluoride as part of the water treatment process since 1969, when Boulder voters approved a ballot measure to require the addition of fluoride to drinking water to reduce tooth decay. Any changes to the fluoridation ordinance would need to be approved by a community vote. All community members also have the opportunity to discuss fluoride at the City of Boulder's Water Resources Advisory Board meetings.  What are the benefits of adding fluoride to drinking water?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fluoridated water strengthens teeth and reduces tooth decay by approximately 25% in adults and children. Nearly all public health, dental, and medical organizations and agencies including the CDC, World Health Organization, American Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend community water fluoridation. The CDC considers drinking water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.  What is the city's process for adding fluoride?During water treatment, the city adds hydrofluorosilicic acid to increase the amount of fluoride in drinking water to a target level of 0.7 mg/L.  Is there a drinking water standard for fluoride?The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set an enforceable drinking water standard for fluoride, also referred to as a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) (i.e., the maximum amount allowed in water from public water systems). The fluoride MCL is 4.0 mg/L. EPA also has a secondary, non-regulatory drinking water guideline of 2.0 mg/L set to protect children against cosmetic effects including tooth discoloration and tooth enamel pitting. The level of fluoride in Boulder’s drinking water is nearly six times lower than the MCL. Fluoridating drinking water is not required, but is a recommended public health measure. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA is prohibited from requiring public water systems to add any substances for preventative health care purposes.  Are there health risks associated with excess levels of fluoride in drinking water?According to EPA, exposure to excessive levels of fluoride over a lifetime may increase the likelihood of bone fractures in adults. Children under the age of nine, who are exposed to prolonged and elevated fluoride levels have an increased likelihood of dental cosmetic effects, such as pitting and discoloration. To protect public health from exposure to excessive levels of fluoride, EPA has established an MCL of 4.0 mg/L, which is nearly six times higher than the amount of fluoride in the city’s drinking water. For more information, see the Other Helpful Resources section, below.  Can I use tap water with fluoride to mix infant formula?The CDC has published a community water fluoridation website providing information about preparing infant formula with fluoridated tap water. According to the CDC, infant formula may be prepared with fluoridated drinking water. If your baby exclusively drinks infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, the CDC notes that your baby may have an increased risk for mild dental fluorosis. To reduce this risk, the CDC recommends mixing the infant formula with low-fluoride bottled water some of the time. Typically, low-fluoride bottled water is labeled as de-ionized, purified, demineralized or distilled.  Other Helpful Resources Center for Disease Control- Community Water Fluoridation U.S. Environmental Protection Agency- Questions and Answers on Fluoride American Academy of Pediatrics- Fluoridation to Prevent Dental Caries American Dental Association- Fluoride in Water Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment- Fluoridation Information City of Fort Collins- Fluoride Technical Study Group Report If you have additional questions, please call the City of Boulder's Drinking Water Program at 303-441-3200 or use the 'Make a Service Request' form below.</td>\n",

       "      <th>Frozen Water Pipes</th>\n",
       "      <td>How can I prevent and thaw frozen water pipes? Frozen water pipes can be avoided with a little planning and a few simple steps. When frigid arctic air hits, water freezes, and as it freezes, it expands -- causing pipes to burst and possibly flood. Pipes that freeze most frequently are those that are exposed to severe cold, such as outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, water sprinkler lines and water supply pipes in unheated interior areas such as basements and crawl spaces, attics, garages or kitchen cabinets. Pipes that run against exterior walls that have little or no insulation are also subject to freezing. Determine where the water shut-off valve is in the house and how to use it in case pipes freeze and break. Boulder's Fire Department recommends that every member of a household know this information and similar to a fire drill, practice turning the valve off and on. To determine where a water shut-off valve is, locate the outside water line that leads to the residence. The water line usually flows directly from the water meter to a location inside the residence. Likely places for the water turn-off valve include internal pipes running against exterior walls or where water service enters a home through the foundation. Before the onset of cold weather, prevent freezing of water supply lines: Drain water from swimming pool and water sprinkler supply lines following manufacturer's or installer's directions. Do not put antifreeze in these lines unless directed. Antifreeze is environmentally harmful and is dangerous to humans, pets, wildlife and landscaping. Remove, drain and carefully store hoses used outdoors. Close inside valves supplying outdoor hose bibs. Open the outside hose taps to allow water to drain. Keep the outside valve open so that any water remaining in the pipe can expand without causing the pipe to break. Check around the home for other areas where water supply lines are located in unheated areas. Look in the basement, crawl space, attic, garage, and under kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Both hot and cold water pipes in these areas should be insulated. A hot water supply line can freeze just as a cold water supply line can freeze if water is not running through the pipe, and the water temperature becomes cold. Consider installing specific products made to insulate water pipes like a \"pipe sleeve\" or installing UL-listed \"heat tape,\" \"heat cable,\" or similar materials on exposed water pipes. Many products are available at a building supplies retailer. Pipes should be carefully wrapped, with ends butted tightly and joints wrapped with tape. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for installing and using these products. Newspaper can provide some degree of insulation and protection to exposed pipes. During cold weather, take preventive action Keep garage doors closed if there are water supply lines in the garage. Open kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children. When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip (at a minimal amount) from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe, even at a trickle, helps prevent frozen pipes. During extreme cold, keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night. If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat set to a temperature no lower than 55ºF. Thaw frozen pipes If your house or basement is flooding, turn off the water valve and call 911. If there is no flooding but you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, make sure your main water valve is turned on. If it is, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the suspected frozen area of the water pipe. As you treat the frozen pipe and the frozen area begins to melt, water will begin to flow through the frozen area. Running water through the pipe will help melt more ice in the pipe. Apply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, electric hair dryer, a portable space heater (kept away from flammable materials), or by wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove or other open flame device. Make sure a heating pad, hair dryer or other electrical devices do not come into contact with water. Keep the faucet open. Apply heat until full water pressure is restored. If you are unable to locate the frozen area, if the frozen area is not accessible or if you cannot thaw the pipe, call a licensed plumber. Check all other faucets in your home to find out if you have additional frozen pipes. If one pipe freezes, others may also freeze. Future Protection Consider relocating exposed pipes to provide increased protection from freezing. For example, if the home is being remodeled, a professional can relocate pipes. To maintain higher temperatures, add insulation to attics, basements and crawl spaces. For more information about frozen pipes, contact a licensed plumber or building professional.</td>\n",

For these tests nontoxic smoke is blown into the sewer system at manholes along the city sewer mains and city crews look for the smoke to surface to locate sewer connections and potential problem areas. This is called smoke testing and is a technique used to find deficiencies in the sanitary sewer system and improper connections that are allowing unwanted groundwater and storm water into the sewers. The city's sanitary sewer system is a separate system from the city's storm sewer system and it is not intended to convey excessive groundwater or stormwater. Smoke testing helps city crews identify the approximate location of the deficiencies and improper connections so that follow up investigations and repairs can be performed. If smoke testing is scheduled in your area, you will receive the following Smoke Testing Sewer Lines Notice. For more information, please review the Smoke Testing Sewer Lines FAQs. Normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday-Friday. After hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as sewer backups, overflows and missing manhole covers. To report an emergency issue including a missing manhole cover, sewage backup, sewage overflow (sewer discharge out of a manhole) or outside sewer odor, please call 303-441-3200 between 7 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday-Friday.

       "      <td>Boulder's sanitary sewer system consists of underground pipes that utilize gravity to collect and transport untreated wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial properties to the city's wastewater treatment facility. This wastewater collection system consists of 355 miles of city-owned sewers and an estimated equal length of privately owned sewer laterals that connect properties to the city's main.The City of Boulder provides routine maintenance, cleaning, and rehabilitation of the city-owned sewer system; however, there is the potential for an unforeseeable sewer blockage or excessive inflow of stormwater into both the city's sewers and privately-owned laterals during extreme rain events. If such an event occurs, wastewater may back up into a building through floor drains, sinks, showers or toilets.Boulder wastewater customers that reside in areas that are prone to such events, including historic districts and low-lying areas, may experience sewer backups. Customers with basements and below-ground properties may also have an increased likelihood of sewer backups. These customers may choose to install backwater valves on their sewer laterals, which are designed to temporarily block sewer pipes and prevent sewage from flowing back up a private sewer lateral. Backwater valves are designed to close either automatically via a float system or manually by closing a valve to prevent wastewater from backing up into a building. While backwater valves are closed, customers cannot use any plumbing fixtures such as toilets or sinks. Once backwater valves are reopened, wastewater resumes its regular flow through the sewer pipes.Licensed plumbers should evaluate each property's specific plumbing configurations to determine whether a backwater valve can be installed in accordance with Uniform Plumbing Code and then provide recommendations about the correct types of devices to use and where to install them. All types of backwater valves must be regularly cleaned, inspected, tested and maintained to ensure that they are functioning properly. A City of Boulder plumbing permit and inspection are required and all types of backwater valves must be installed on existing sanitary sewer lines by a licensed plumbing contractor. Private property owners can also purchase insurance coverage for sewer backups. Visit bouldercolorado.gov/flood/flood-insurance or www.floodsmart.gov for details.</td>\n",

Please read the back of your ticket carefully and follow the instructions printed on it. If you have any questions, call the Boulder Municipal Court at 303-441-1842. I received a ticket but I don't live in Colorado so I won't be able to appear in court. What can I do?If your ticket is marked as a mail-in ticket, you can follow the instructions on the back of your ticket and mail in the fine. If your ticket is marked as \"not a mail-in,\" you must send a written request to be allowed to plead guilty by mail. Include in your request the ticket number as well as a current address and phone number where you can be reached. Send your request to: City of BoulderCity Attorney's OfficeProsecution DivisionPO Box 8015Boulder, Colorado 80306 When the written request is received, a motion to the court will be made asking the court to allow you to plead guilty by mail and pay a fine. If the motion is approved by the court, you will receive a copy of the motion from the court. You will need to sign the motion and pay the fine by the date noted in the motion. Please note that you may not plea bargain by mail - you may only plead guilty. If you want to try to plea bargain your case, you must appear in court or contact a private attorney to appear in your absence. Can I speak with a prosecuting attorney before I come to court?Are you a defendant, witness or victim? If you are a defendant with a traffic ticket, it is necessary to wait for the court date written on the ticket before speaking to a prosecuting attorney. When you appear in court, you will be advised by the judge of your legal rights. You will then have an opportunity to speak with a prosecuting attorney regarding your case. If you are a witness or a victim, you may call the Prosecution Division of the City Attorney's Office at 303-441-3025. What is an arraignment?An arraignment is the first court appearance for any traffic or other municipal code violation. At this hearing, the Municipal Court judge will hear all cases scheduled for that day's docket. Defendants appearing that day will be advised of their rights and given the opportunity to plead guilty or not guilty and to discuss their cases with a prosecuting attorney or attorney's assistant. A prosecuting attorney will review all traffic tickets before the arraignment date and make a plea bargain offer in writing, where appropriate. At your arraignment, you may accept this offer, enter your plea, and pay the fine and court costs assessed. If you do not wish to accept the plea offer, you may speak with a prosecuting attorney to discuss your case. Please be advised that the pre-screened offer is almost always the best offer that will be made by a prosecuting attorney and may not be changed. Each defendant who has met with a prosecuting attorney or attorney's assistant will then return before the Municipal Court judge and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. Those entering guilty pleas will be assessed court fees and fines, pay for any damages caused by their actions, and their case will be at an end. Those entering not guilty pleas will be assigned another court date for a trial of their case. Do I need to bring an attorney with me to my arraignment?An attorney is generally not needed at an arraignment, although individuals can choose to bring private attorneys with them. What is a disposition (\"dispo\")?A disposition is a final resolution of a case. You must appear in court before the judge. It may include an agreed-upon plea and sentence negotiated between a prosecuting attorney and defendant. All dispositions must be approved by a judge in open court. A disposition date is set by the Municipal Court and can only be changed by the court. Call 303-441-1842 for more information. What is a pretrial conference?A pretrial conference is a meeting between a prosecuting attorney and a defendant and/or defendant's attorney to discuss the case and the possibility of a plea agreement. A pretrial conference can be held on the day of a defendant's arraignment after the court has advised the defendant of their legal rights. If a defendant has an attorney, the attorney can call and schedule a pretrial conference at a time other than the day of arraignment. In some complex cases, a second appointment may be made for a pretrial conference at a later date. I received a waiver of personal service and a subpoena in the mail, what are my options, and who can I call if I have questions about this?The subpoena waiver is mailed to all prosecution witnesses needed to appear at a trial in Boulder Municipal Court. It is important that the signed subpoena waiver be mailed back as soon as possible. You will then be legally required to appear as a witness at trial. If the waiver is signed and returned in the stamped envelope provided, you will not have to be personally served. The name of the defendant and the date and time of the trial are noted in the subpoena waiver. Options Sign and return the subpoena waiver as soon as possible and appear in court on the trial date to testify. Do not sign or return the waiver. If not returned within seven days before trial, a police officer or process server may be sent to your home or business to personally serve your subpoena.

There are also several types of miscellaneous business licenses needed for businesses such as \"door to door sales,\" pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers. For more information, view the Business Licensing Questions. Where can I locate my business?Boulder's zoning laws specify types of business uses allowed at specific locations. Each property is in a designated zoning district and each zoning district lists the allowed uses for that district. Some types of business uses or those with certain operating characteristics are only allowed with a public review process such as \"use review.\" Email a Project Specialist in the Planning & Development Services Center or call 303-441-1880 to learn more about zoning districts and to confirm that your proposed business use is allowed before signing a lease or purchasing a property. You can also visit the Services Center at 1739 Broadway on the third floor. Can I run my business out of my home?Home occupations are allowed in Boulder as long the business meets certain standards. The main requirements are that no employees may work for the business except for those who live in the home, traffic may not exceed the level expected for a residence, and no business signs may be displayed. Please submit a completed home occupation form with your business license application. How do I know what taxes my business must pay? If your business is located in the City of Boulder, you need to collect and remit sales tax and use tax. If you are an outside business and created \"nexus,\" you need to license and collect and remit sales tax. If you deliver goods to another city, please check with that city for licensing requirements. Your business may be subject to other taxes such as food service, accommodations or admissions tax depending on your business type.

Street sweeping services include sweeping and cleaning streets and gutters to remove dirt, debris, and hazards to increase safety, improve drainage, and reduce dust and air pollution. Most of the work is accomplished using mechanical sweepers and hand cleaning is performed at inaccessible locations. The city only performs street sweeping on roads maintained by the city.

Who owns the railroad tracks in Boulder?Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway owns and operates all railroad tracks in the City of Boulder. Who controls the railroad crossings in the Boulder area?There are ten crossings in the immediate vicinity of Boulder. Five are on roads controlled by the city and five are on county-controlled roads. Therefore, the city and county are coordinating to establish quiet zones in the Boulder area, as federal rules stipulate that the agency that controls the road at the crossing must apply for Quiet Zone status. ﻿Who regulates the sounding of train horns at railroad crossings?The sounding of train horns at crossings is regulated by federal rules from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). ﻿Why has train noise increased in recent years?We understand that train horn noise has increased over the past decade, despite the number of trains passing through our community remaining fairly stable. This is due to federal rules, which were adopted in 2005, mandating a consistent pattern and decibel level of horn sounding at public at-grade crossings. Previously, locomotive engineers had more discretion as to when the train horn was sounded, and could, for example, choose not to sound the train horn at a given crossings at night if no hazards were present on the tracks. The federal rules now require that all trains sound horns between 96 and 110 decibels at all public crossings. However, in the same 2005 rulemaking process, the FRA established a process by which road authorities can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horns at crossings. Information concerning quiet zones is available at http://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0889.  ﻿What can legally be done to decrease train noise at crossings?The same 2005 FRA rules that governed the blowing of horns also established a process by which local governments can establish \"quiet zones,\" which remove the requirement for train operators to routinely sound their horn at all crossings. Information on the use of locomotive horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings can be found on the FRA website. ﻿How are quiet zones established?Crossings considered for Quiet Zone establishment are evaluated by a diagnostic team consisting of the road authority who owns and maintains the roadway, the railroad operating over the crossing, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, and the Colorado Department of Transportation. There are several crossing improvement treatments that are pre-approved by the FRA called Supplementary Safety Measures (SSMs). These improvements can include a combination of features such as railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and construction of raised medians. Each crossing is evaluated to determine which treatments are needed at the crossing. Crossings treated with SSMs require only a notification to the FRA for Quiet Zone establishment. The cost for these installations is higher, but use of SSM treatments results in a permanent Quiet Zone. Another option for Quiet Zone establishment is through the use of Alternative Safety Measures (ASMs). These are typically non-engineering solutions such as photo enforcement. This option requires an application to the FRA along with documentation to support the selected treatment. Once applied for, the FRA will evaluate the treatment and approve or deny the application. Approval of ASM alternatives includes stipulations regarding enforcement, monitoring and reporting to the FRA on a regular basis. If any incidents occur, or the stipulations are not met, the Quiet Zone designation can be revoked. ﻿What is the cost of establishing a quiet zone?The diagnostic review at each crossing helps the team determine what infrastructure is currently in place, and what, if any additional installations are necessary to meet the requirements of one of the SSM treatments. Addition of gates, flashers, bells, and railroad circuitry can cost $350,000. Crossings that already have the railroad equipment may only need the construction of raised medians, which can be done for under $50,000 per crossing. The cost is based on what crossing warning devices and roadway features exist at the crossing when it is evaluated for consideration of Quiet Zone establishment. There is no readily available documentation of costs for Quiet Zone establishment using ASMs. While the infrastructure cost may be lower than an SSM treatment, the cost of enforcement, monitoring and reporting over a longer period of time may result in expenditures relatively comparable to the SSM treatment. ﻿How difficult is it to establish a \"quiet zone?Colorado is home to 10 Quiet Zones in 6 different communities. The process involves a cooperative effort between the road authority, railroad, and agencies with jurisdiction over crossing and roadway safety (Colorado Public Utilities Commission and Colorado Department of Transportation). Use of SSM treatments, while more costly, result in a shorter timeline to Quiet Zone establishment because the SSM treatments have been tested and approved by the FRA. Crossings with much of the equipment already present can be established as Quiet Zones in less than one year. Crossings requiring a greater amount of equipment installation or roadway construction can be established as Quiet Zones in 18 months to three years. However, implementation estimates assume funding sources that are already identified. The City of Boulder received $1.2 million from the Denver Regional Council of Governments for quiet zone design and construction. The city's Railroad Quiet Zones web page has the latest information on this project. ﻿In the case of an accident at a railroad crossing, who is liable?The first Quiet Zone in Colorado was established in Commerce City in 2007. The crossings involved were treated with SSMs, which result in warning devices at the crossings to make the crossings safer. There have been no incidents at these crossings since Quiet Zone establishment, even though trains are not sounding their horns. The FRA has indicated that the courts will ultimately determine who will be held liable if a collision occurs at a grade crossing located within a Quiet Zone, as the collision may have been caused by factors other than the absence of an audible warning. The Final Rule is intended to remove \"failure to sound the locomotive horn\" as a cause of action in lawsuits involving collisions at grade crossings located within Quiet Zones. Therefore, FRA expects that the courts will determine liability issues based on the facts of each case, the FRA's regulatory intent and the nature of this rule and its Federal requirements. ﻿Do quiet zones increase the likelihood of accidents at railroad crossings?Crossings treated with SSMs, which can include a combination of railroad gates, flashers, upgraded railroad circuitry and raised medians, are treated with engineered solutions that provide visual, audible and physical warning at a grade crossing that a train is approaching. These crossings are, by default, safer crossings, as they have more infrastructure and warning devices that discourage, and in some cases, physically prohibit a motorist from entering the tracks during approach of a train. Accidents at crossings treated with SSMs have no more likelihood of occurring than at standard crossings you may see that have approach railroad gates that descend when activated by an approaching train. Crossings treated with ASM solutions, which include non-engineered options, may not have any additional warning devices installed as part of the treatment, but also no longer have train horns sounding. There are currently no Quiet Zones that have been successfully established with non-engineered solutions. Therefore, there are no statistics to support a higher rate of accidents at this time. ﻿Are quiet zones really quiet?Experts estimate that 90 percent of train noise comes from blowing the horns, so quiet zones can make a significant difference. Other noise comes from the engines and from train wheels, particularly on curved sections of track. A variety of infrastructure improvements can be used at quiet zones. Some communities have chosen to replace the train-mounted horns with horns mounted on the poles at the crossings. The pole-mounted horns are more directional (aimed down at the railway), which can reduce the number of homes and businesses impacted by the noise. Whether or not these pole-mounted horns are appropriate for some Boulder crossings is being explored by staff. ﻿What is the city currently doing about quiet zones? City staff has been following this issue for many years and working with the regional partners including Boulder County, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), Regional Transportation District (RTD), neighboring communities, and the BNSF, FRA and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. The city commissioned a Railroad Quiet Zone study to refine cost estimates for implementing quiet zones at the BNSF railroad crossings in and near the City of Boulder (this includes several crossings located in Boulder County). This work also provides a clearer picture of the actual needs at individual railroad crossings as well as necessary potential education and enforcement programs. The city conducted a public engagement process with the community to inform a prioritization and phasing plan for implementation. Projects have been prioritized as follows:  47th StreetValmont RoadPearl Parkway63rd Street at the Diagonal Highway55th Street north of Arapahoe Avenue63rd Street north of Arapahoe AvenuePrevious discussions with RTD with regard to the Northwest Rail line can be found in the Guidelines for City of Boulder Participation in the Northwest Rail Environmental Evaluation.What is RTD's involvement in helping to establish quiet zones? City staff has also been following this issue for many years and working with the Regional Transportation Division (RTD) and other partners to understand the processes, costs and infrastructure requirements for implementing quiet zones. RTD is planning to construct quiet zone improvements along much of the Northwest (NW) Rail corridor if it is built, which is currently estimated for 2030 and beyond.

Eco Pass Can I purchase the Eco Pass for myself of family members?No, the Eco Pass can only be purchased by employers for their employees as a group employee benefit package. Family members are not eligible; however, there is a Neighborhood Eco (NECO) Pass Program. Can Eco Passes be purchased only for employees who ride the bus?No, employers must purchase one pass for every full-time employee at a given work site. A business can choose to either exclude or include all part-time employees as well. Is an Eco Pass less expensive than a monthly pass?Yes. Find rate information at RTD Denver's website. What if I terminate my employment?Your Eco Pass is only good as long as you are an employee of an Eco Pass employer. All passes must be returned to your employer upon termination, or employees/employers may be assessed a fee for non-return. What if I lose my pass?Report your lost pass to your employer as soon as possible. Lost passes cost a small fee to be replaced. RTD will charge you for the lost/stolen pass when you obtain your replacement pass. If your pass is stolen and you present a police report to RTD, the fee for a first-time replacement will be reduced. You will be required to pay a fee to your employer if your pass is missing upon termination. How does the City of Boulder subsidize the Eco Pass Program?The City of Boulder will offer a rebate on any Eco Pass contract to employers who have an employee on staff that participates in GO Boulder's ETC network. Please visit the ETC page for more information.Questions, Concerns, Comments, Lost Items? For all transit service questions or issues except for the HOP service, please contact RTD at 303-299-6000 or visit RTD's website.

The City of Boulder controls water quality up to the point of a private property. After this point, water quality can be degraded or contaminated within a private property. When backflow occurs, water from inside a private property can be pushed or pulled back into the community's drinking water supply.

Bulk water will be turned off during the weekends and holidays. Prior to purchasing bulk water for the first time, customers must come to 5050 Pearl Street and complete a one-page user permit form and obtain a key required to dispense the bulk water. Upon completing the permit form and receipt of the key, customers can start buying water immediately. The initial water key will be free, a replacement key costs $40. Bulk water costs $8 per 1,000 gallons and customers will receive a water bill in the mail from the city's Utility Billing office. Please note that use of bulk water for fracking purposes is a violation of account terms and will result in the termination of bulk water privileges and possibly prosecution. If a customer has problems dispensing bulk water, come to 5050 Pearl Street and ask for help. To cancel a bulk water account, customers must come to 5050 Pearl Street and drop off the water key.

The EPA requires local agencies to enforce these standards in their jurisdictions. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) is the regulating agency for Colorado.

Discolored WaterRunning several taps with cold water at full force for a short period may help flush the discolored water out of your system. A general recommendation is to run the taps for five minutes. If the water is not clear, wait for half an hour before running them for five minutes again.

Boulder's water sources contain small amounts of natural fluoride. The City of Boulder also adds fluoride to the drinking water to achieve a target level of 0.7 mg/L, which is based on 2015 federal and state guidance. The City of Boulder continues to pay close attention to scientific and regulatory developments and, as always, will comply with all regulatory changes.Why is fluoride added to drinking water?The City of Boulder has added fluoride as part of the water treatment process since 1969, when Boulder voters approved a ballot measure to require the addition of fluoride to drinking water to reduce tooth decay. Any changes to the fluoridation ordinance would need to be approved by a community vote. All community members also have the opportunity to discuss fluoride at the City of Boulder's Water Resources Advisory Board meetings.  What are the benefits of adding fluoride to drinking water?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fluoridated water strengthens teeth and reduces tooth decay by approximately 25% in adults and children. Nearly all public health, dental, and medical organizations and agencies including the CDC, World Health Organization, American Dental Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend community water fluoridation. The CDC considers drinking water fluoridation one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.  What is the city's process for adding fluoride?During water treatment, the city adds hydrofluorosilicic acid to increase the amount of fluoride in drinking water to a target level of 0.7 mg/L.  Is there a drinking water standard for fluoride?The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set an enforceable drinking water standard for fluoride, also referred to as a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) (i.e., the maximum amount allowed in water from public water systems). The fluoride MCL is 4.0 mg/L. EPA also has a secondary, non-regulatory drinking water guideline of 2.0 mg/L set to protect children against cosmetic effects including tooth discoloration and tooth enamel pitting. The level of fluoride in Boulder’s drinking water is nearly six times lower than the MCL. Fluoridating drinking water is not required, but is a recommended public health measure. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA is prohibited from requiring public water systems to add any substances for preventative health care purposes.  Are there health risks associated with excess levels of fluoride in drinking water?According to EPA, exposure to excessive levels of fluoride over a lifetime may increase the likelihood of bone fractures in adults. Children under the age of nine, who are exposed to prolonged and elevated fluoride levels have an increased likelihood of dental cosmetic effects, such as pitting and discoloration. To protect public health from exposure to excessive levels of fluoride, EPA has established an MCL of 4.0 mg/L, which is nearly six times higher than the amount of fluoride in the city’s drinking water.

According to the CDC, infant formula may be prepared with fluoridated drinking water. If your baby exclusively drinks infant formula reconstituted with fluoridated water, the CDC notes that your baby may have an increased risk for mild dental fluorosis. To reduce this risk, the CDC recommends mixing the infant formula with low-fluoride bottled water some of the time. Typically, low-fluoride bottled water is labeled as de-ionized, purified, demineralized or distilled.  Other Helpful Resources Center for Disease Control- Community Water Fluoridation U.S.

Frozen water pipes can be avoided with a little planning and a few simple steps. When frigid arctic air hits, water freezes, and as it freezes, it expands -- causing pipes to burst and possibly flood. Pipes that freeze most frequently are those that are exposed to severe cold, such as outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, water sprinkler lines and water supply pipes in unheated interior areas such as basements and crawl spaces, attics, garages or kitchen cabinets. Pipes that run against exterior walls that have little or no insulation are also subject to freezing. Determine where the water shut-off valve is in the house and how to use it in case pipes freeze and break. Boulder's Fire Department recommends that every member of a household know this information and similar to a fire drill, practice turning the valve off and on. To determine where a water shut-off valve is, locate the outside water line that leads to the residence. The water line usually flows directly from the water meter to a location inside the residence. Likely places for the water turn-off valve include internal pipes running against exterior walls or where water service enters a home through the foundation. Before the onset of cold weather, prevent freezing of water supply lines: Drain water from swimming pool and water sprinkler supply lines following manufacturer's or installer's directions. Do not put antifreeze in these lines unless directed. Antifreeze is environmentally harmful and is dangerous to humans, pets, wildlife and landscaping. Remove, drain and carefully store hoses used outdoors. Close inside valves supplying outdoor hose bibs. Open the outside hose taps to allow water to drain. Keep the outside valve open so that any water remaining in the pipe can expand without causing the pipe to break. Check around the home for other areas where water supply lines are located in unheated areas. Look in the basement, crawl space, attic, garage, and under kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Both hot and cold water pipes in these areas should be insulated. A hot water supply line can freeze just as a cold water supply line can freeze if water is not running through the pipe, and the water temperature becomes cold. Consider installing specific products made to insulate water pipes like a \"pipe sleeve\" or installing UL-listed \"heat tape,\" \"heat cable,\" or similar materials on exposed water pipes. Many products are available at a building supplies retailer. Pipes should be carefully wrapped, with ends butted tightly and joints wrapped with tape. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for installing and using these products. Newspaper can provide some degree of insulation and protection to exposed pipes. During cold weather, take preventive action Keep garage doors closed if there are water supply lines in the garage. Open kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children. When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip (at a minimal amount) from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe, even at a trickle, helps prevent frozen pipes. During extreme cold, keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night. If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat set to a temperature no lower than 55ºF. Thaw frozen pipes If your house or basement is flooding, turn off the water valve and call 911. If there is no flooding but you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, make sure your main water valve is turned on. If it is, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the suspected frozen area of the water pipe. As you treat the frozen pipe and the frozen area begins to melt, water will begin to flow through the frozen area. Running water through the pipe will help melt more ice in the pipe. Apply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, electric hair dryer, a portable space heater (kept away from flammable materials), or by wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove or other open flame device. Make sure a heating pad, hair dryer or other electrical devices do not come into contact with water. Keep the faucet open. Apply heat until full water pressure is restored. If you are unable to locate the frozen area, if the frozen area is not accessible or if you cannot thaw the pipe, call a licensed plumber. Check all other faucets in your home to find out if you have additional frozen pipes. If one pipe freezes, others may also freeze. Future Protection Consider relocating exposed pipes to provide increased protection from freezing. For example, if the home is being remodeled, a professional can relocate pipes. To maintain higher temperatures, add insulation to attics, basements and crawl spaces.

The depth of utility lines varies and there may be multiple utility lines in a common area and damaging a utility can disrupt service to an entire neighborhood, harm you and those around you and potentially result in fines and repair costs. Call 811 a few days prior to digging, and your call will be routed to your local One Call Center. Tell the operator where you're planning to dig, what type of work you will be doing and your affected local utilities. The City of Boulder Public Works Department and other utility companies will be notified about your intent to dig. Within a few days, a locator will mark the approximate location of your underground lines, pipes and cables, so you'll know what's below - and be able to dig safely. Remember, always call 811 before you start any digging project!

Common causes of outages are main breaks, service line breaks, planned water main maintenance or water main replacement. The city notifies customers in advance of planned water shutdowns but is unable to provide advance notice for unplanned or emergency events such as a main break. To report a water service disruption, please call 303-441-3200 between 7 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday. At any other time, please call 303-441-3245. Please ALWAYS call the listed phone numbers to report a water outage and do not report via Inquire Boulder.  This system is not designed to manage urgent and emergency service requests and is NOT monitored 24-7.For maintenance problems such as frozen pipes indoors or no hot water, please contact a private plumber. The city also offers an interactive web map called Water Distribution Info Center that displays locations and live information about planned and unplanned water shutoffs, including main breaks and annual water utility projects.

For these tests nontoxic smoke is blown into the sewer system at manholes along the city sewer mains and city crews look for the smoke to surface to locate sewer connections and potential problem areas. This is called smoke testing and is a technique used to find deficiencies in the sanitary sewer system and improper connections that are allowing unwanted groundwater and storm water into the sewers. The city's sanitary sewer system is a separate system from the city's storm sewer system and it is not intended to convey excessive groundwater or stormwater. Smoke testing helps city crews identify the approximate location of the deficiencies and improper connections so that follow up investigations and repairs can be performed. If smoke testing is scheduled in your area, you will receive the following Smoke Testing Sewer Lines Notice. For more information, please review the Smoke Testing Sewer Lines FAQs. Normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday-Friday. After hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as sewer backups, overflows and missing manhole covers. To report an emergency issue including a missing manhole cover, sewage backup, sewage overflow (sewer discharge out of a manhole) or outside sewer odor, please call 303-441-3200 between 7 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday-Friday. At any other time, please call 303-441-3245.  Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.  In the event of a sewer backup on your property, the city will respond and determine the cause of the backup and assist if possible. Sewer customers should be aware that the sanitary sewer service line is the responsibility of the property owner up to and including the connection to the city-owned sewer main. If the problem is determined to be in the sewer service line, it is recommend that you call a plumber to investigate and resolve the problem. For all non-emergency sewer issues, please submit a service request for this item in the 'Make a Service Request' area below. Do NOT use Inquire Boulder to request utility locates prior to digging. All requests for utility locates must go through the 811 dispatch center.

This wastewater collection system consists of 355 miles of city-owned sewers and an estimated equal length of privately owned sewer laterals that connect properties to the city's main.The City of Boulder provides routine maintenance, cleaning, and rehabilitation of the city-owned sewer system; however, there is the potential for an unforeseeable sewer blockage or excessive inflow of stormwater into both the city's sewers and privately-owned laterals during extreme rain events. If such an event occurs, wastewater may back up into a building through floor drains, sinks, showers or toilets.Boulder wastewater customers that reside in areas that are prone to such events, including historic districts and low-lying areas, may experience sewer backups. Customers with basements and below-ground properties may also have an increased likelihood of sewer backups. These customers may choose to install backwater valves on their sewer laterals, which are designed to temporarily block sewer pipes and prevent sewage from flowing back up a private sewer lateral. Backwater valves are designed to close either automatically via a float system or manually by closing a valve to prevent wastewater from backing up into a building. While backwater valves are closed, customers cannot use any plumbing fixtures such as toilets or sinks. Once backwater valves are reopened, wastewater resumes its regular flow through the sewer pipes.Licensed plumbers should evaluate each property's specific plumbing configurations to determine whether a backwater valve can be installed in accordance with Uniform Plumbing Code and then provide recommendations about the correct types of devices to use and where to install them. All types of backwater valves must be regularly cleaned, inspected, tested and maintained to ensure that they are functioning properly. A City of Boulder plumbing permit and inspection are required and all types of backwater valves must be installed on existing sanitary sewer lines by a licensed plumbing contractor. Private property owners can also purchase insurance coverage for sewer backups.

This will refill the P-trap, which is intended to block sewer odors from entering the house from the service line. Then open windows to vent the affected area. If the odor does not dissipate within several hours or if you are smelling a sewer odor outdoors, please call Utilities Maintenance at 303-441-3200 between 7 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday.

If you believe you have suffered damages or other impacts to your private property due to the activities of neighboring property owners diverting or discharging water, you may wish to consult with a private attorney to explore your legal rights. The city cannot provide legal advice to people who believe they have suffered damages due to an adjacent or nearby property owner diverting water onto a neighbor's property. If any fence, wall or berm was (or is) being constructed to divert drainage without a building permit, contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to alert an inspector of the possible violation.Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off of Private Property onto Public Property like Sidewalks, Streets or GuttersThe City of Boulder regulates the discharge or diversion of water onto public property under the Boulder Revised Code Chapter 8-2-8: Discharging Water Prohibited. Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines. To report water being pumped or diverted onto any public property such as an alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, right-of-way, or street, call 303-441-4237 or \"Make a Service Request\" below.

Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you. If you can see the source of the water and it's bubbling or spraying up from under the ground or roadway, call 303-441-3200 from 7 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or 303-441-3249 after-hours, to report a water main (pipe) break.

The water department also routinely operates valves and flushes fire hydrants to ensure reliable, high-quality, potable water service.  City water customers are advised to know the location of the water shutoff valve inside their home (different from the water meter valve) and how to shut off water in case of an emergency, such as a broken or frozen water pipe. This knowledge can help prevent extensive and expensive damage to your property. The water department's normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.  After-hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as water main breaks.To report an emergency water maintenance issue, including a city water main leak or break, please call 303-441-3200. Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.  Water customers should be aware that after a water main break, tap water may temporarily have a light brown or yellow color. The cause is typically common iron rust from inside the city water pipes.Visit the Drinking Water Quality and Discolored Water Questions page for more information.  The city also offers an interactive web map called the Water Distribution Info. Center that displays locations and live information about planned and unplanned water shutoffs, including main breaks and annual water utility projects.    For all non-emergency water maintenance issues, including fire hydrant and water meter issues, please select the \"Make a Service Request\" button below or call 303-441-3200.  Do NOT use Inquire Boulder to request utility locates prior to digging. All requests for utility locates must go through the 811 dispatch center.

The dashboard and metrics will be iterative. There will be new data sets and measurements added, as appropriate, and updates to existing data will be made in a timely and consistent way. Phase One provides a starting point to gather input on metrics - those that will be included in the initial launch as well as future metrics the community would like to see - site design, and overall site functionality. The information gathered will inform scoping of Phase Two. We would love to hear your input!

       "      <td>Colorado Parks and Wildlife has provided this list of Frequently Asked Questions in response to questions about mountain lion management in the City of Boulder.  Colorado Parks and Wildlife is responsible for the direct management of all wildlife in the state.   Mountain Lion Frequently Asked Questions   1.  Why are there lions in Boulder? Wildlife requires, and will seek out, adequate habitat in order to survive.  The land surrounding Boulder including Open Space and Mountain Parks, US Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties and the private land in mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for lions.  Habitat can be described as four basic needs: food, shelter, water, and space.  Lions come into and use the City of Boulder from the surrounding areas because within the city limits all four of these needs ca be met.  Food is found in the form of deer, small mammals, livestock, and pets.  Shelter includes not only the heavy vegetation throughout the city in yards and along irrigation ditches, but also human-made shelter such as the spaces underneath decks.  There is an abundance of water, in ponds, ditches, and in backyard water features (fountains and backyard ponds).  Finally, space is available in backyards, parks, and in the ditches and creeks, which serve as ideal movement corridors for lions and other wildlife.  There are lions in Boulder because there is quality habitat in Boulder, and lions do not recognize city limits when seeking a living.   2.  What do lions eat? Lions are opportunistic, predatory carnivores and will prey on a variety of large and small mammals, both wild and domestic.  In Colorado, lions most often prey on deer, but they will also kill and feed on other large mammals such as elk and bighorn sheep.  If left unprotected, domestic livestock such as llamas, ponies, goats, sheep and chickens can become food for lions.  Lions will also feed on a variety of small mammals such as raccoons, foxes, coyotes, squirrels, and domestic pets.  To minimize conflicts between domestic animals and lions, livestock should be kept in secure, fully enclosed structures, especially near dawn, dusk, and throughout the nighttime hours.  When allowed outdoors, pets should be closely supervised or kept in secure enclosures (with a roof) at all times.   3.  What is a cache and what does it look like? A cache is the carcass of something that a lion has killed.  Lions sometimes drag their kill a short distance to a place they feel is protected before they start to feed on it.  When a lion is finished feeding, it will partially cover, or “cache” the kill by scraping the ground substrate (eg. pine needles, twigs, leaves or dirt) over the carcass.  The lion may leave the area until the next feeding, or may guard the cache and stay very close to it.  Depending on the size of the kill, the lion may return periodically for several days to feed on the carcass.  If you see a carcass that looks like it may have been cached, stay away from the carcass and call the Boulder Police non-emergency number at 303-441-3333 (anytime) or Colorado Parks and Wildlife at 303-291-7227 (business hours – 8:00 – 5:00).      4.  Why can’t Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) take all of lions out of town and keep them out? There is no feasible way to keep lions out of the City of Boulder and due to the often unpredictable nature of wildlife, there are not always opportunities to remove each lion from the city before that lion leaves on its own.   When appropriate, CPW officers will attempt to capture lions either by tranquillizing them with a dart gun, by using a baited trap, or using other techniques.  Officers may also attempt to haze lions out of the city using tools such as rubber buckshot.  Hazing, capture and/or relocation may not be appropriate, practical, or successful in every situation.  When a mountain lion is relocated two outcomes are possible: either the relocated lion returns to its former range, or a different lion moves into the vacated territory which may include a portion of the City of Boulder.   Additionally, lions can jump over very high fences and there are no proven techniques to exclude mountain lions from large areas like the City of Boulder.    5.  What does Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) do about lions in town? The CPW follows a statewide directive when responding to mountain lions in the City of Boulder.  Each situation is dynamic and unique as to what actions are appropriate, safe and effective when dealing with a particular lion in a particular location.  In addition, CPW does not have the opportunity to take action on every lion that comes into town as lions often return on their own to the foothills west of the City.  Given the fact that situations involving wildlife are never the same and outcomes are rarely predictable there are no cut and dried answers for dealing with lions in town, but generally speaking the following are true:  if a lion sighting is reported in the City of Boulder an officer will respond and attempt to locate the lion.  This could be a CPW officer, a City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks ranger, an animal control officer, or a police officer. While responding to the initial call and during the follow up CPW officers and City of Boulder officers work together to provide the most timely and appropriate level of response necessary.  Public safety is always the primary consideration in determining the appropriate response on lions in Boulder.     If a lion is located a CPW officer will respond and, depending on each individual situation, may attempt to haze the lion out of town or tranquilize the lion using a tranquilizer dart gun.  If a lion kills a deer or other wildlife in a yard in the city and “caches” it (see Question 3), a wildlife officer, only with permission from the homeowner, may set a trap and attempt to trap and relocate the lion.  CPW will kill lions that are aggressive towards people, or lions that are determined to be dangerous.  Additionally, the CPW makes every reasonable attempt to notify and educate neighbors and neighborhoods about lions in town by posting signs, knocking on doors, and providing information on neighborhood websites.  CPW and the City of Boulder are always working together to develop the most efficient avenues of notification and continue to try to improve communication about lions and lion activity. Boulder residents and visitors should be aware that a lion may be encountered at any time and should always take appropriate precautions to minimize conflicts with lions (See Questions 8 and 9)   6.  Is Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) waiting until someone is injured or killed before doing something about the lions? CPW and City of Boulder officers that work in and around Boulder are committed to doing whatever they can to protect people and pets from mountain lions.   They currently do so not only by educating and informing residents of Boulder but also by hazing, tranquilizing, trapping, and relocating lions when appropriate and feasible, and killing individual lions when necessary (see Question 5).  Unfortunately, CPW cannot exclude lions from the city and cannot completely eliminate all risk to people and pets from mountain lions. Therefore, to minimize the risk of lion conflicts it is essential that residents and visitors to Boulder be vigilant and responsive to lion activity in their community.  CPW continues to encourage the thoughtful discussion between neighbors, CPW, and the City of Boulder on what can be done to discourage the presence of lions in the city and what measures people can take knowing that lions may be present at any time (see Questions 8, 9 and 10).    7.  What are the risks to humans from lions? In Colorado, there have been 2 confirmed deaths and 1 suspected death caused by mountain lions.  All three have occurred since 1990, and all of these incidents occurred in undeveloped areas away from towns.  In Boulder, the natural areas surrounding the city experience high visitation (an estimated 4.7 million visits to city Open Space and Mountain Parks (OSMP) property during a 12-month period in 2004 and 2005[1]) and there has been one reported attack on OSMP property which occurred in 2006.  Four additional people were injured by mountain lions in Boulder County between 1990 and 2000, all of which also occurred outside the Boulder city limits.  Across the wider range of mountain lions in the western United States and Canada, attacks on humans are also very rare.   There has been an average of 0.2 annual human deaths in all of North America from mountain lions between 1900 and 2007[2].  This number is very low compared to annual deaths from black widow spiders (1.4 between 1950-1989), domestic dogs (16 between 1979-1998) and car crashes (45,000 between 1980-2005).   While the risk of a lion attack is very low, there is still a risk associated with living or recreating in lion habitat.  The obvious facts to take into account are that lions are predators, they prey on large mammals, and throughout their range they have on very rare occasions been responsible for some human injuries and deaths.  It is up to individuals to balance these facts and decide it means to them, how they fit into an individual’s daily risk management, and what steps they are willing to take to mitigate those risks (see Questions 8 and 9).    8.  What can I do to keep myself/my kids safe?  Can my kids play outside and walk to school unsupervised? The most important thing you can do to reduce the risk to you and your family is to be aware that mountain lions are, at times, present in the City of Boulder.  The next step is to educate yourself and everyone in your house about mountain lions.  A great place to start is on the CPW website: http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/LivingwithWildlifeLion1.aspx .    Colorado Parks and Wildlife recommends that children be supervised when outside in lion, bear and coyote habitat.  The risk of injury or death to humans from lions, including children, is very low (see Question 7), however there is a minimal level of risk that cannot be completely eliminated in Boulder.   Some parents feel most comfortable when their children are directly supervised by an adult at all times.  Depending on the child’s age and maturity, others feel comfortable educating their children on what to do if they see a lion and allow their children to walk to school or play outside with a group of friends.  Some parents give their child a whistle or air horn to signal a problem or concern (wildlife or otherwise) if they are playing outside without an adult immediately present.  Teach your children to be aware of wildlife and what to do if they encounter wildlife.  Practicing scenarios ahead of time can better prepare children for an unexpected encounter with various wildlife species, including mountain lions.   Adults may decide to do more or less than what is recommended.  There are many decisions we make every day to minimize a variety of risks to our children, our pets, and ourselves.  In Boulder, there is the extra necessity of considering the risks from wildlife when making those decisions. Each individual, pet owner, and parent must evaluate the risk for themselves and make the decisions they find to be most appropriate.   9.  What can I do to keep my pets safe? There are actions you can take to reduce the risk to your pets from mountain lions.  First, it is important to note that lions routinely kill deer and other large mammals for food (see Question 2) and have killed dogs as large as a Great Pyrenees. Therefore, don’t assume because you have a large dog that it is safe.  Colorado Parks and Wildlife recommends that you always supervise your pets when they are outside.  Most pets are attacked near dusk, during the night, and near dawn (see Question 14).  Therefore, if your dog needs to go outside during these hours put it on a leash and go with it— carry a flash light, talk in a loud voice, and carefully look around your backyard before you go out.  If you must leave your pet unattended outside, build a fully enclosed kennel (including a roof or sturdy fencing on top).  Finally, keep your cat indoors.  Cats face risks not only from mountain lions but also foxes, owls, and coyotes.  Keeping them indoors is the only way to keep house cats safe.   10.  How can I discourage lions coming onto or near my property? If you remove what is considered to be habitat from your property you will reduce the incentive for a lion to come onto your property.  This habitat can be described as four basic needs.   The first is food.  Mule deer make up a large proportion of a lion’s diet.  By planting vegetation that deer do not like to eat or by using landscaping products meant to exclude deer you can remove a primary attractant.  That said, lions will also eat raccoons and small mammals.  By securing your garbage properly and blocking off access to places animals might choose to den, you will also exclude species that make up the rest of a lion’s diet.  Additionally, do not feed wildlife.  Feeding deer and fox not only has the potential to attract mountain lions to your yard but is illegal in the City of Boulder.    Next is water. Water features in a backyard are huge attractants for a variety of wildlife including lions.  If you don’t want lions in your backyard then you should not have water features.    The last two needs for habitat are shelter and space.  To limit these you should eliminate any places in your yard that serve as good hiding places.  Lions are ambush predators and stalk prey from cover. Low lying, large bushes and shrubs, spaces under decks, or any place that wildlife can rest comfortably without being seen should be removed or blocked off.  Installing outside lighting can help you see a lion if it is on your property, and may make it less inviting.   11.  Are there more lions in town now than in the past?  Some long-time residents believe so… Unfortunately, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) does not have data to definitively answer this question.  Some long-time residents of Boulder have expressed that they had rarely heard of or seen a mountain lion in the city until the recent past.  Others say that they have always known that lions come into the city from time to time.  Because so many factors affect the behavior and movement of wildlife and people’s perception of it, it is very difficult to do any more than speculate as to why reported, perceived, or actual lion activity in Boulder has increased.  Lion sightings and/or pet attacks in the City of Boulder can occur sporadically, or in clusters.   Several months may pass without a single report of a lion in the City, or several reports may be received in a single week.   The clusters of activity may be caused by one lion, or by different lions.     12. Will I encounter lions east of Broadway? Lions occasionally travel east of Broadway, though sightings on the west side of Boulder near the foothills are much more common.  In recent years lions have been confirmed in areas such as Gunbarrel, Lafayette, Longmont, Firestone, Aurora, eastern Colorado and some Midwestern states.  Anyone residing in or visiting the City of Boulder should be aware that they may encounter a lion at any time and in any neighborhood.  See lion activity map for confirmed lion sightings and activity in the city between March and July 2009.   13. Are the lions that are moving and hunting near homes and people in the city becoming so habituated to people that they pose an elevated risk?  If a lion is brazen enough to kill a pet in a backyard isn’t its next logical prey a human? Numbers have shown that throughout their range lions choose to prey on deer and other four legged animals and despite ample opportunity, not on humans.  For us, it is more logical to think of our pets as a member of our human family, but to a lion your dog shares much more in common with a normal prey item such as a raccoon.   The Cougar Management Guidelines Working Group stated in 2005 that there was no scientific evidence to indicate that cougar habituation to humans affects the risk of attack. [3]  So while mountain lions may be more visible in the City and pets are certainly at an elevated risk there is nothing to suggest that this habituation increases the existing risk to people from mountain lions.    14.  When are lions most active?  Is it unusual to see a lion in the middle of the day? Lions are most active near dusk, dawn, and anytime throughout the night.  This is when they are typically moving and hunting for prey and this is when the majority of sightings, encounters and conflicts, such pet attacks, occur.  Lions can be active at any time of day or night, however, and it is not unusual or abnormal for lions to be spotted moving or hunting during daylight hours.       15.  What does it mean if a lion has eartags and/or a collar?  Are you tracking lions? Eartags are placed on wildlife that have been previously captured for any reason.  Lions are typically moved due to being in an inappropriate location (such as within the City limits of Boulder), because they were orphaned and needed to be rehabilitated before release, or because of nuisance behavior.  The eartag colors depend on the circumstance of capture, but typically in the northeast region of the state, lions will have green eartags.    Colorado Parks and Wildlife conducted a Front Range Mountain Lion Research Study between 2008 and 2015.  Lions that were captured and put into the study will have eartags, as well as a collar with GPS capabilities.  Some goals of the study included finding ways to get better lion population estimates, getting a better understanding of how lions utilize habitat to move between urban fringe areas and more rural, open lands within their home ranges, and finding ways to minimize human-lion conflicts.  More information on the study can be found at: http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/ResearchMammalsRP-12.aspx.   16.  If Colorado Parks and Wildlife wants to capture a lion, what methods are used? Whether or not capture efforts are initiated, and what methods might be used, depends on the location and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the activity.  Many times when a sighting is reported the lion typically leaves the area on its own without incident and is therefore unable to be located.  If a lion has a cache that can be located, (see Question 3), a live box trap may be set using the cache as bait, since the lion will likely return to feed on the cache at some point.  If a lion is free-roaming in the City of Boulder, we may attempt to tranquilize it if we can locate it and get close enough to effectively shoot it with a dart.  Hounds may be used in limited situations if there is an injury to a human from a lion.  When hounds are used they are carefully controlled to minimize risk of injury to the lion or hounds.       17. Who should I call when I see a lion? For general mountain lion information, including recommended precautions for living in Mountain Lion country, call: Colorado Parks and Wildlife – (303) 291-7227 or visit http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/LivingwithWildlifeLion1.aspx   To report sightings within the City of Boulder, call: Boulder Police non-emergency number – (303) 441-3333 OR Colorado Parks and Wildlife (business hours) – (303) 291-7227   To report encounters, a stationary lion, or pet attacks within the City of Boulder, call: Boulder Police non-emergency number – (303) 441-3333   Call 911 in the event of an immediate human safety issue, or if a human is injured by any wildlife   18.  When should I call about a lion? You can call anytime to report sightings, tracks, or to request information on lions and other wildlife.  The City of Boulder and Colorado Parks Wildlife would like to be made aware of sightings within the City limits (especially lions that are stationary for a period of time), pet attacks, and carcasses that appear to be caches (see Question 3).  Any human injury caused by wildlife should be reported immediately by calling 911.        [1] Vaske, J.J., Shelby, L.B., &amp; Donnelly, M.P.

       "147  Colorado Parks and Wildlife has provided this list of Frequently Asked Questions in response to questions about mountain lion management in the City of Boulder.  Colorado Parks and Wildlife is responsible for the direct management of all wildlife in the state.   Mountain Lion Frequently Asked Questions   1.  Why are there lions in Boulder? Wildlife requires, and will seek out, adequate habitat in order to survive.  The land surrounding Boulder including Open Space and Mountain Parks, US Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties and the private land in mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for lions.  Habitat can be described as four basic needs: food, shelter, water, and space.  Lions come into and use the City of Boulder from the surrounding areas because within the city limits all four of these needs ca be met.  Food is found in the form of deer, small mammals, livestock, and pets.  Shelter includes not only the heavy vegetation throughout the city in yards and along irrigation ditches, but also human-made shelter such as the spaces underneath decks.  There is an abundance of water, in ponds, ditches, and in backyard water features (fountains and backyard ponds).  Finally, space is available in backyards, parks, and in the ditches and creeks, which serve as ideal movement corridors for lions and other wildlife.  There are lions in Boulder because there is quality habitat in Boulder, and lions do not recognize city limits when seeking a living.   2.  What do lions eat? Lions are opportunistic, predatory carnivores and will prey on a variety of large and small mammals, both wild and domestic.  In Colorado, lions most often prey on deer, but they will also kill and feed on other large mammals such as elk and bighorn sheep.  If left unprotected, domestic livestock such as llamas, ponies, goats, sheep and chickens can become food for lions.  Lions will also feed on a variety of small mammals such as raccoons, foxes, coyotes, squirrels, and domestic pets.  To minimize conflicts between domestic animals and lions, livestock should be kept in secure, fully enclosed structures, especially near dawn, dusk, and throughout the nighttime hours.  When allowed outdoors, pets should be closely supervised or kept in secure enclosures (with a roof) at all times.   3.  What is a cache and what does it look like? A cache is the carcass of something that a lion has killed.  Lions sometimes drag their kill a short distance to a place they feel is protected before they start to feed on it.  When a lion is finished feeding, it will partially cover, or “cache” the kill by scraping the ground substrate (eg. pine needles, twigs, leaves or dirt) over the carcass.  The lion may leave the area until the next feeding, or may guard the cache and stay very close to it.  Depending on the size of the kill, the lion may return periodically for several days to feed on the carcass.  If you see a carcass that looks like it may have been cached, stay away from the carcass and call the Boulder Police non-emergency number at 303-441-3333 (anytime) or Colorado Parks and Wildlife at 303-291-7227 (business hours – 8:00 – 5:00).      4.  Why can’t Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) take all of lions out of town and keep them out? There is no feasible way to keep lions out of the City of Boulder and due to the often unpredictable nature of wildlife, there are not always opportunities to remove each lion from the city before that lion leaves on its own.   When appropriate, CPW officers will attempt to capture lions either by tranquillizing them with a dart gun, by using a baited trap, or using other techniques.  Officers may also attempt to haze lions out of the city using tools such as rubber buckshot.  Hazing, capture and/or relocation may not be appropriate, practical, or successful in every situation.  When a mountain lion is relocated two outcomes are possible: either the relocated lion returns to its former range, or a different lion moves into the vacated territory which may include a portion of the City of Boulder.   Additionally, lions can jump over very high fences and there are no proven techniques to exclude mountain lions from large areas like the City of Boulder.    5.  What does Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) do about lions in town? The CPW follows a statewide directive when responding to mountain lions in the City of Boulder.  Each situation is dynamic and unique as to what actions are appropriate, safe and effective when dealing with a particular lion in a particular location.  In addition, CPW does not have the opportunity to take action on every lion that comes into town as lions often return on their own to the foothills west of the City.  Given the fact that situations involving wildlife are never the same and outcomes are rarely predictable there are no cut and dried answers for dealing with lions in town, but generally speaking the following are true:  if a lion sighting is reported in the City of Boulder an officer will respond and attempt to locate the lion.  This could be a CPW officer, a City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks ranger, an animal control officer, or a police officer. While responding to the initial call and during the follow up CPW officers and City of Boulder officers work together to provide the most timely and appropriate level of response necessary.  Public safety is always the primary consideration in determining the appropriate response on lions in Boulder.     If a lion is located a CPW officer will respond and, depending on each individual situation, may attempt to haze the lion out of town or tranquilize the lion using a tranquilizer dart gun.  If a lion kills a deer or other wildlife in a yard in the city and “caches” it (see Question 3), a wildlife officer, only with permission from the homeowner, may set a trap and attempt to trap and relocate the lion.  CPW will kill lions that are aggressive towards people, or lions that are determined to be dangerous.  Additionally, the CPW makes every reasonable attempt to notify and educate neighbors and neighborhoods about lions in town by posting signs, knocking on doors, and providing information on neighborhood websites.  CPW and the City of Boulder are always working together to develop the most efficient avenues of notification and continue to try to improve communication about lions and lion activity. Boulder residents and visitors should be aware that a lion may be encountered at any time and should always take appropriate precautions to minimize conflicts with lions (See Questions 8 and 9)   6.  Is Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) waiting until someone is injured or killed before doing something about the lions? CPW and City of Boulder officers that work in and around Boulder are committed to doing whatever they can to protect people and pets from mountain lions.   They currently do so not only by educating and informing residents of Boulder but also by hazing, tranquilizing, trapping, and relocating lions when appropriate and feasible, and killing individual lions when necessary (see Question 5).  Unfortunately, CPW cannot exclude lions from the city and cannot completely eliminate all risk to people and pets from mountain lions. Therefore, to minimize the risk of lion conflicts it is essential that residents and visitors to Boulder be vigilant and responsive to lion activity in their community.  CPW continues to encourage the thoughtful discussion between neighbors, CPW, and the City of Boulder on what can be done to discourage the presence of lions in the city and what measures people can take knowing that lions may be present at any time (see Questions 8, 9 and 10).    7.  What are the risks to humans from lions? In Colorado, there have been 2 confirmed deaths and 1 suspected death caused by mountain lions.  All three have occurred since 1990, and all of these incidents occurred in undeveloped areas away from towns.  In Boulder, the natural areas surrounding the city experience high visitation (an estimated 4.7 million visits to city Open Space and Mountain Parks (OSMP) property during a 12-month period in 2004 and 2005[1]) and there has been one reported attack on OSMP property which occurred in 2006.  Four additional people were injured by mountain lions in Boulder County between 1990 and 2000, all of which also occurred outside the Boulder city limits.  Across the wider range of mountain lions in the western United States and Canada, attacks on humans are also very rare.   There has been an average of 0.2 annual human deaths in all of North America from mountain lions between 1900 and 2007[2].  This number is very low compared to annual deaths from black widow spiders (1.4 between 1950-1989), domestic dogs (16 between 1979-1998) and car crashes (45,000 between 1980-2005).   While the risk of a lion attack is very low, there is still a risk associated with living or recreating in lion habitat.  The obvious facts to take into account are that lions are predators, they prey on large mammals, and throughout their range they have on very rare occasions been responsible for some human injuries and deaths.  It is up to individuals to balance these facts and decide it means to them, how they fit into an individual’s daily risk management, and what steps they are willing to take to mitigate those risks (see Questions 8 and 9).    8.  What can I do to keep myself/my kids safe?  Can my kids play outside and walk to school unsupervised? The most important thing you can do to reduce the risk to you and your family is to be aware that mountain lions are, at times, present in the City of Boulder.  The next step is to educate yourself and everyone in your house about mountain lions.  A great place to start is on the CPW website: http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/LivingwithWildlifeLion1.aspx .    Colorado Parks and Wildlife recommends that children be supervised when outside in lion, bear and coyote habitat.  The risk of injury or death to humans from lions, including children, is very low (see Question 7), however there is a minimal level of risk that cannot be completely eliminated in Boulder.   Some parents feel most comfortable when their children are directly supervised by an adult at all times.  Depending on the child’s age and maturity, others feel comfortable educating their children on what to do if they see a lion and allow their children to walk to school or play outside with a group of friends.  Some parents give their child a whistle or air horn to signal a problem or concern (wildlife or otherwise) if they are playing outside without an adult immediately present.  Teach your children to be aware of wildlife and what to do if they encounter wildlife.  Practicing scenarios ahead of time can better prepare children for an unexpected encounter with various wildlife species, including mountain lions.   Adults may decide to do more or less than what is recommended.  There are many decisions we make every day to minimize a variety of risks to our children, our pets, and ourselves.  In Boulder, there is the extra necessity of considering the risks from wildlife when making those decisions. Each individual, pet owner, and parent must evaluate the risk for themselves and make the decisions they find to be most appropriate.   9.  What can I do to keep my pets safe? There are actions you can take to reduce the risk to your pets from mountain lions.  First, it is important to note that lions routinely kill deer and other large mammals for food (see Question 2) and have killed dogs as large as a Great Pyrenees. Therefore, don’t assume because you have a large dog that it is safe.  Colorado Parks and Wildlife recommends that you always supervise your pets when they are outside.  Most pets are attacked near dusk, during the night, and near dawn (see Question 14).  Therefore, if your dog needs to go outside during these hours put it on a leash and go with it— carry a flash light, talk in a loud voice, and carefully look around your backyard before you go out.  If you must leave your pet unattended outside, build a fully enclosed kennel (including a roof or sturdy fencing on top).  Finally, keep your cat indoors.  Cats face risks not only from mountain lions but also foxes, owls, and coyotes.  Keeping them indoors is the only way to keep house cats safe.   10.  How can I discourage lions coming onto or near my property? If you remove what is considered to be habitat from your property you will reduce the incentive for a lion to come onto your property.  This habitat can be described as four basic needs.   The first is food.  Mule deer make up a large proportion of a lion’s diet.  By planting vegetation that deer do not like to eat or by using landscaping products meant to exclude deer you can remove a primary attractant.  That said, lions will also eat raccoons and small mammals.  By securing your garbage properly and blocking off access to places animals might choose to den, you will also exclude species that make up the rest of a lion’s diet.  Additionally, do not feed wildlife.  Feeding deer and fox not only has the potential to attract mountain lions to your yard but is illegal in the City of Boulder.    Next is water. Water features in a backyard are huge attractants for a variety of wildlife including lions.  If you don’t want lions in your backyard then you should not have water features.    The last two needs for habitat are shelter and space.  To limit these you should eliminate any places in your yard that serve as good hiding places.  Lions are ambush predators and stalk prey from cover. Low lying, large bushes and shrubs, spaces under decks, or any place that wildlife can rest comfortably without being seen should be removed or blocked off.  Installing outside lighting can help you see a lion if it is on your property, and may make it less inviting.   11.  Are there more lions in town now than in the past?  Some long-time residents believe so… Unfortunately, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) does not have data to definitively answer this question.  Some long-time residents of Boulder have expressed that they had rarely heard of or seen a mountain lion in the city until the recent past.  Others say that they have always known that lions come into the city from time to time.  Because so many factors affect the behavior and movement of wildlife and people’s perception of it, it is very difficult to do any more than speculate as to why reported, perceived, or actual lion activity in Boulder has increased.  Lion sightings and/or pet attacks in the City of Boulder can occur sporadically, or in clusters.   Several months may pass without a single report of a lion in the City, or several reports may be received in a single week.   The clusters of activity may be caused by one lion, or by different lions.     12. Will I encounter lions east of Broadway? Lions occasionally travel east of Broadway, though sightings on the west side of Boulder near the foothills are much more common.  In recent years lions have been confirmed in areas such as Gunbarrel, Lafayette, Longmont, Firestone, Aurora, eastern Colorado and some Midwestern states.  Anyone residing in or visiting the City of Boulder should be aware that they may encounter a lion at any time and in any neighborhood.  See lion activity map for confirmed lion sightings and activity in the city between March and July 2009.   13. Are the lions that are moving and hunting near homes and people in the city becoming so habituated to people that they pose an elevated risk?  If a lion is brazen enough to kill a pet in a backyard isn’t its next logical prey a human? Numbers have shown that throughout their range lions choose to prey on deer and other four legged animals and despite ample opportunity, not on humans.  For us, it is more logical to think of our pets as a member of our human family, but to a lion your dog shares much more in common with a normal prey item such as a raccoon.   The Cougar Management Guidelines Working Group stated in 2005 that there was no scientific evidence to indicate that cougar habituation to humans affects the risk of attack. [3]  So while mountain lions may be more visible in the City and pets are certainly at an elevated risk there is nothing to suggest that this habituation increases the existing risk to people from mountain lions.    14.  When are lions most active?  Is it unusual to see a lion in the middle of the day? Lions are most active near dusk, dawn, and anytime throughout the night.  This is when they are typically moving and hunting for prey and this is when the majority of sightings, encounters and conflicts, such pet attacks, occur.  Lions can be active at any time of day or night, however, and it is not unusual or abnormal for lions to be spotted moving or hunting during daylight hours.       15.  What does it mean if a lion has eartags and/or a collar?  Are you tracking lions? Eartags are placed on wildlife that have been previously captured for any reason.  Lions are typically moved due to being in an inappropriate location (such as within the City limits of Boulder), because they were orphaned and needed to be rehabilitated before release, or because of nuisance behavior.  The eartag colors depend on the circumstance of capture, but typically in the northeast region of the state, lions will have green eartags.    Colorado Parks and Wildlife conducted a Front Range Mountain Lion Research Study between 2008 and 2015.  Lions that were captured and put into the study will have eartags, as well as a collar with GPS capabilities.  Some goals of the study included finding ways to get better lion population estimates, getting a better understanding of how lions utilize habitat to move between urban fringe areas and more rural, open lands within their home ranges, and finding ways to minimize human-lion conflicts.  More information on the study can be found at: http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/ResearchMammalsRP-12.aspx.   16.  If Colorado Parks and Wildlife wants to capture a lion, what methods are used? Whether or not capture efforts are initiated, and what methods might be used, depends on the location and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the activity.  Many times when a sighting is reported the lion typically leaves the area on its own without incident and is therefore unable to be located.  If a lion has a cache that can be located, (see Question 3), a live box trap may be set using the cache as bait, since the lion will likely return to feed on the cache at some point.  If a lion is free-roaming in the City of Boulder, we may attempt to tranquilize it if we can locate it and get close enough to effectively shoot it with a dart.  Hounds may be used in limited situations if there is an injury to a human from a lion.  When hounds are used they are carefully controlled to minimize risk of injury to the lion or hounds.       17. Who should I call when I see a lion? For general mountain lion information, including recommended precautions for living in Mountain Lion country, call: Colorado Parks and Wildlife – (303) 291-7227 or visit http://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/LivingwithWildlifeLion1.aspx   To report sightings within the City of Boulder, call: Boulder Police non-emergency number – (303) 441-3333 OR Colorado Parks and Wildlife (business hours) – (303) 291-7227   To report encounters, a stationary lion, or pet attacks within the City of Boulder, call: Boulder Police non-emergency number – (303) 441-3333   Call 911 in the event of an immediate human safety issue, or if a human is injured by any wildlife   18.  When should I call about a lion? You can call anytime to report sightings, tracks, or to request information on lions and other wildlife.  The City of Boulder and Colorado Parks Wildlife would like to be made aware of sightings within the City limits (especially lions that are stationary for a period of time), pet attacks, and carcasses that appear to be caches (see Question 3).  Any human injury caused by wildlife should be reported immediately by calling 911.        [1] Vaske, J.J., Shelby, L.B., & Donnelly, M.P.
