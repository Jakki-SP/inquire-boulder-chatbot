       "'Council colleagues: See below two pieces of good news from Boulder Housing Partners. Best, Bob From: Jeremy Durham <DurhamJ@boulderhousing.org> Sent: Tuesday, December 11, 2018 10:26 AM To: BHP_Commissioners Cc: Laura Sheinbaum; Tim Beal Subject: Two Updates Commissioners: I’m writing with two updates that might be of interest. First, last week we received an award of $13.8MM in Private Activity Bond (PAB) cap from the State Department of Local Affairs for the 30Pearl project. As a reminder, 4% tax credits can only be utilized with PABs. As the statewide demand for affordable housing has increased in recent years, PABs have become a scarce resource and securing them a more competitive process. We are thrilled to have received this support from the State. While this is great news for the project, 30Pearl will need approximately $28MM in PABs. Over the next year we’ll work to secure commitments for the remaining PABs from either the State, CHFA, or the City. Second, I’d encourage you to take a look at this video that Grid Alternatives put out featuring our latest solar garden that will sustainably support BHP and our residents energy needs. Thanks to Tim Beal for helping make this a reality. https://www.facebook.com/gridalternatives/videos/2318267638455351/ See you all tomorrow. Best, Jeremy Durham Executive Director Boulder Housing Partners 720.564.4644'"
