       "      <td>If a dog is causing a nuisance and disturbing your peace, there are some steps you can follow to help resolve the issue. The first step to take is to try and talk with your neighbor. Many people are unaware that their dog barks when they are absent. They may not be aware that their dog's barking is bothering you. Speaking with the dog guardian often solves the problem. If you are uncomfortable speaking with your neighbor, a polite note placed on the front door or mailed to the address can help make them aware of the problem. While the city does recommend trying to solve the dispute with your neighbor to reach an amiable solution on your own, speaking with your neighbor is a suggestion and not a requirement when dealing with barking dogs. If attempting to address the barking dog problem on your own fails, call the Boulder Police Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report the problem. Be prepared to provide Animal Protection with the following information: the address of the barking dog; exact date(s) and time(s) of the barking, preferably the most recent occurrence; and a description of the dog(s), if you can provide one. The City of Boulder has a two-step process when dealing with nuisance dogs. Once you have provided the necessary information, Boulder Police Animal Protection will contact the dog's guardian and issue a written warning. Animal Protection will meet with the guardian in person to help them identify what is causing the barking and try to find a solution. In accordance with city ordinance, a written warning must be issued prior to a summons being served. After the warning is issued, give the guardian 10 to 14 days to identify the cause and possible resolutions to the nuisance barking. Many times, guardians need to utilize trial and error to discover which bark-control methods work best for their dog If the written warning is not successful and additional enforcement action must be taken, two reporting parties are required for a court summons to be issued. The reporting parties will need to complete witness statements for the same date/time/duration for a court summons to be issued.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dogs bark for many reasons, and determining what causes the barking is the first tool to begin to resolve the problem behavior. Some common reasons that dogs bark are listed below. Boredom/loneliness - Dogs are pack animals, are not solitary, and do not like to be left alone. They need a lot of attention and stimulation. Territorial/protection - Dogs will bark at people or animals that come near their territory to get them to leave. This can often appear to be aggressive behavior. Separation anxiety - Dogs with separation anxiety often bark excessively when left alone. Dogs who have separation anxiety will often pace and exhibit destructive behavior. Alarm/fear - Some dogs will bark at anything that startles them or catches their attention. There are many things throughout a day that may startle a dog. Be a good neighborA barking dog can be disruptive to your neighbors and can put a strain on your relationship. It can also lead to a court summons if allowed to continue. There are many ways to help curb your dog's barking. A few common methods are listed below. Give your dog a special toy or long-lasting treat to entertain them while you are away. Daily exercise will stimulate your dog both physically and mentally, making them a much calmer, more enjoyable pet. Ultra-sonic bark control devices are typically placed outside around the yard and emit a high-pitched sound every time the dog barks. Citronella bark collars spray an unpleasant smell towards the dog's nose every time they bark. Electronic bark collars emit a static electric charge when the dog is barking.</td>\n",

All vaccinations must be provided by a Colorado-licensed veterinarian. City of Boulder dog licenseA City of Boulder dog license is required for all dogs over the age of four months living within the city limits. The license serves as identification to enable officers to contact you if your dog is lost or injured, and to ensure that your dog is currently vaccinated against rabies. The license must be obtained within 30 days of acquiring the dog or within 30 days of moving to Boulder. In order to purchase a city dog license, a guardian must provide proof of a current rabies vaccination. All dogs are required to wear their City of Boulder dog license tag on their collar or harness at all times. Keep in mind that the Open Space &amp; Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag is not a substitute for a city dog license. Aggressive animalsNo person shall own or keep any aggressive animal.

An animal that bites, claws, or attempts to bite or claw any person, or bites or injures another animal, will be considered a vicious animal. Be sure to keep your pets under control at all times to prevent an incident such as an attack or bite. Animal cruelty or neglectAll animals in Boulder are legally protected from being abandoned, beaten, tortured, injured, transported in an unsafe manner, or killed. Failure to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, grooming, opportunity for exercise, or sanitary conditions is a violation of city ordinance.

       "11   The Boulder Municipal Airport has a voluntary noise abatement program. Noise abatement procedures are designed to minimize the level of aircraft noise near residential areas while ensuring the safety of flight operations. Pilots are asked to be aware of noise-sensitive neighborhoods and to follow the voluntary noise abatement procedures during operations. To report a noise concern, complete the Noise Abatement report form or call 303-441-3108.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "27   Animal Protection Please contact Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint. Boulder Animal Protection is a division of the Boulder Police Department that enforces all city ordinances related to animals and state laws related to domestic animals. Animal Protection responds to animal-related complaints and promotes responsible pet ownership through enforcement, mediation and education. Officers investigate and respond to: roaming dogs; dangerous or aggressive animals; animal bites; cruelty and/or neglect to animals; animal noise (barking dogs); excess animal feces; leash law and tethering violations; dog licensing violations; and injured and orphaned small wildlife. Animal Rules and RegulationsThe City of Boulder's animal laws were developed to ensure the health and safety of residents and their pets. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. Leash lawAll dogs in the City of Boulder must be kept on leashes at all times unless they are confined to their owner's property. Dogs that roam loose present a danger to the community and may be hit by a car or attacked by other animals. An exception for your dog to run free is to utilize one of the designated off-leash dog parks. If you have obtained an Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag for your dog, you must utilize the designated opens space areas that are participating in that program. Rabies vaccinationCity of Boulder law requires all dogs and cats over the age of four months to be vaccinated against rabies. After the initial vaccination, animals must be kept current on rabies vaccinations using either a one-year or three-year vaccination. All vaccinations must be provided by a Colorado-licensed veterinarian. City of Boulder dog licenseA City of Boulder dog license is required for all dogs over the age of four months living within the city limits. The license serves as identification to enable officers to contact you if your dog is lost or injured, and to ensure that your dog is currently vaccinated against rabies. The license must be obtained within 30 days of acquiring the dog or within 30 days of moving to Boulder. In order to purchase a city dog license, a guardian must provide proof of a current rabies vaccination. All dogs are required to wear their City of Boulder dog license tag on their collar or harness at all times. Keep in mind that the Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag is not a substitute for a city dog license. Aggressive animalsNo person shall own or keep any aggressive animal. An aggressive animal is one that approaches a person in a vicious or terrorizing attitude of attack. An animal that bites, claws, or attempts to bite or claw any person, or bites or injures another animal, will be considered a vicious animal. Be sure to keep your pets under control at all times to prevent an incident such as an attack or bite. Animal cruelty or neglectAll animals in Boulder are legally protected from being abandoned, beaten, tortured, injured, transported in an unsafe manner, or killed. Failure to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, grooming, opportunity for exercise, or sanitary conditions is a violation of city ordinance. Violators will be strictly prosecuted for these infractions. Barking dog nuisance Boulder's animal noise ordinance states that it is unlawful for an owner to allow an animal to disturb the peace with loud and habitual barking, howling, whining, or baying. If you notice that your dog barks unnecessarily, it is your responsibility to identify the problem and resolve it immediately to prevent a disturbance to your neighborhood. Clean up after your animalPicking up your pet's waste is required by city ordinance. It is an important way to help preserve our environment and prevent the spread of disease. Please be courteous to other Boulder community members by cleaning up after your pet. CatsWhile not subject to leash and licensing laws, cats must be vaccinated against rabies beginning at four months of age. Cats must also be restrained from creating a nuisance by leaving feces or damaging the property of another. If a cat is causing a nuisance by defecating or destroying property, a property owner has the legal right to remove the cat from their property and bring it to the local animal shelter. The guardian may also be charged with owning a nuisance cat. Impound and board fees apply to impounded cats. Strict liability Boulder animal laws are strict liability laws. Therefore, an animal's guardian is liable even when there is no proof of negligence or intent. The guardian is responsible for their animal's actions, regardless of the circumstances, accidental or otherwise. If an animal injures, kills, or damages any person, other animal, or property, the strict liability law holds the guardian or keeper of the animal legally responsible, and includes all costs and damages incurred. PenaltiesIn addition to impoundment fees, guardians are subject to a court summons for violations of the city animal ordinances. The maximum penalty for each violation is $1,000 and/or 90 days in jail. Fines are subject to increase for subsequent violations.    \n",

The provisions of this chapter are intended to help ensure that trash, recyclables and compostables are disposed of in an appropriate and timely manner, that such materials are properly screened and to support waste reduction programs that promote recycling and composting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "624  The city does not pick up tree branches. However, there are several ongoing options for managing your yard waste: Residents may place any yard debris, along with food waste, for free in their curbside compost collection cart. As part of the regular compost collection, on each regularly-scheduled collection day, all haulers are required by law to also pick up (for free): Three extra bags of leaves placed outside the compost cart - AND Three additional bundles of branches - six feet long by three feet wide. If there is more than one branch in the bundle, it must be tied with non-plastic twine so it can be picked up by the collection crews and can be composted.

       "629  The City of Boulder's Failure to Pay Wages Due ordinance prohibits non-payment of wages or compensation by an employer that has a duty to pay those wages or compensation. Failure to pay wages cases are handled by the city's Office of Human Rights. Most cases are resolved through facilitation or mediation. Cases that are not resolved may be prosecuted in the Boulder Municipal Court. If you believe that your employer may be in violation of this ordinance, please contact Community Relations and Office of Human Rights at 303-441-3140.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

There is no minimum requirement for compost collection capacity at multi-family residential properties.• For more information about where to take items that are more difficult to dispose of visit Eco-Cycle's Center for Hard-to-Recycle Materials (CHaRM) website at www.ecocycle.org/charm• For more information about where to drop off hazardous materials, visit the Boulder County Hazardous Waste website at www.bouldercounty.org/env/hazwaste                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "631  Water Being Pumped or Diverted from One Private Property onto Another The City of Boulder does not regulate the discharge or diversion of water from one private property onto another private property. If you believe you have suffered damages or other impacts to your private property due to the activities of neighboring property owners diverting or discharging water, you may wish to consult with a private attorney to explore your legal rights. The city cannot provide legal advice to people who believe they have suffered damages due to an adjacent or nearby property owner diverting water onto a neighbor's property. If any fence, wall or berm was (or is) being constructed to divert drainage without a building permit, contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to alert an inspector of the possible violation.Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off of Private Property onto Public Property like Sidewalks, Streets or GuttersThe City of Boulder regulates the discharge or diversion of water onto public property under the Boulder Revised Code Chapter 8-2-8: Discharging Water Prohibited. Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines. To report water being pumped or diverted onto any public property such as an alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, right-of-way, or street, call 303-441-4237 or \"Make a Service Request\" below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "632  Water Seeping into BasementsThe level of groundwater (the depth below ground where the soil is saturated, also called the water table) varies throughout Boulder and some areas have a higher water table than others. Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you. If you can see the source of the water and it's bubbling or spraying up from under the ground or roadway, call 303-441-3200 from 7 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or 303-441-3249 after-hours, to report a water main (pipe) break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "633  The city maintains more than 450 miles of water pipe that serve more than 29,000 customers. The water department also maintains and services about 4,700 fire hydrants. All fire hydrant maintenance, including inspections, repairs and painting is managed by Public Works, not the Fire-Rescue Department. The water department also routinely operates valves and flushes fire hydrants to ensure reliable, high-quality, potable water service.  City water customers are advised to know the location of the water shutoff valve inside their home (different from the water meter valve) and how to shut off water in case of an emergency, such as a broken or frozen water pipe. This knowledge can help prevent extensive and expensive damage to your property. The water department's normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.  After-hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as water main breaks.To report an emergency water maintenance issue, including a city water main leak or break, please call 303-441-3200. Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.  Water customers should be aware that after a water main break, tap water may temporarily have a light brown or yellow color. The cause is typically common iron rust from inside the city water pipes.Visit the Drinking Water Quality and Discolored Water Questions page for more information.  The city also offers an interactive web map called the Water Distribution Info. Center that displays locations and live information about planned and unplanned water shutoffs, including main breaks and annual water utility projects.    For all non-emergency water maintenance issues, including fire hydrant and water meter issues, please select the \"Make a Service Request\" button below or call 303-441-3200.  Do NOT use Inquire Boulder to request utility locates prior to digging. All requests for utility locates must go through the 811 dispatch center.

The city is working with FEMA and other partners to assess and address the significant damages in these areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "641  Please call Code Enforcement at 303-441-1875 to ask questions or report a code violation. Service requests submitted online will receive a response within four business days (7:00 am - 5:00 pm, except holidays). \"No burn\" restrictions are issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. In addition, the Boulder city manager may designate \"no burn\" days when monitoring indicates actual or potential violations of air quality standards established by either the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, or when meteorological conditions warrant such designation. Wood Burning Restrictions 6-9-3(c) Residents may not burn solid fuel devices during a declared \"no burn\" day unless: The person had obtained a temporary exemption demonstrating both an economic need to burn solid fuel for building space heating purposes and a reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. The city manager may grant such exemptions according to the following standards. A person applying for an exemption must demonstrate economic need by certifying eligibility for energy assistance according to economic guidelines established by the United States Office of Management and Budget under the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP), as administered by Boulder County. A person applying for an exemption must sign a verified affidavit demonstrating reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. An exemption obtained under this section shall be effective for one year from the date it is granted. A power outage, interruption of natural gas supply, or temporary equipment failure existed at the time and location of the violation that did not result from any action of the person charged with the violation. The burning occurred in a EPA-certified wood stove or in a solid fuel burning device that meets the same emission standards as are required for a Phase III-certified wood stove and is tested by an EPA-accredited laboratory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "16    The city is responsible for the safe and efficient operation and maintenance of the airport. The city works to balance the impacts of airport operations and the needs of airport users with the needs of the community. To do this, the city controls land use around the Boulder Municipal Airport and dictates procedures for aircraft operations on the ground (aircraft in the air are regulated by the FAA). The Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan outlines the policy for land use around the airport, and the Airport Master Plan outlines operations of the airport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "19    Airport Day is a fun, low-key event for the whole family, held every other year on Father's Day weekend at the Boulder Municipal Airport. The next Airport Day will be on Saturday, June 14, 2014. The 2012 event featured World War II planes, antique planes, aerobatic planes, a military helicopter, gliders and much more. Visitors were able to look inside the aircraft, ask questions of the pilots and take photos. There were also fire/rescue trucks, food vendors and rides in two different kinds of helicopters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "25   If a dog is causing a nuisance and disturbing your peace, there are some steps you can follow to help resolve the issue. The first step to take is to try and talk with your neighbor. Many people are unaware that their dog barks when they are absent. They may not be aware that their dog's barking is bothering you. Speaking with the dog guardian often solves the problem. If you are uncomfortable speaking with your neighbor, a polite note placed on the front door or mailed to the address can help make them aware of the problem. While the city does recommend trying to solve the dispute with your neighbor to reach an amiable solution on your own, speaking with your neighbor is a suggestion and not a requirement when dealing with barking dogs. If attempting to address the barking dog problem on your own fails, call the Boulder Police Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report the problem. Be prepared to provide Animal Protection with the following information: the address of the barking dog; exact date(s) and time(s) of the barking, preferably the most recent occurrence; and a description of the dog(s), if you can provide one. The City of Boulder has a two-step process when dealing with nuisance dogs. Once you have provided the necessary information, Boulder Police Animal Protection will contact the dog's guardian and issue a written warning. Animal Protection will meet with the guardian in person to help them identify what is causing the barking and try to find a solution. In accordance with city ordinance, a written warning must be issued prior to a summons being served. After the warning is issued, give the guardian 10 to 14 days to identify the cause and possible resolutions to the nuisance barking. Many times, guardians need to utilize trial and error to discover which bark-control methods work best for their dog If the written warning is not successful and additional enforcement action must be taken, two reporting parties are required for a court summons to be issued. The reporting parties will need to complete witness statements for the same date/time/duration for a court summons to be issued.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "26   Dogs bark for many reasons, and determining what causes the barking is the first tool to begin to resolve the problem behavior. Some common reasons that dogs bark are listed below. Boredom/loneliness - Dogs are pack animals, are not solitary, and do not like to be left alone. They need a lot of attention and stimulation. Territorial/protection - Dogs will bark at people or animals that come near their territory to get them to leave. This can often appear to be aggressive behavior. Separation anxiety - Dogs with separation anxiety often bark excessively when left alone. Dogs who have separation anxiety will often pace and exhibit destructive behavior. Alarm/fear - Some dogs will bark at anything that startles them or catches their attention. There are many things throughout a day that may startle a dog. Be a good neighborA barking dog can be disruptive to your neighbors and can put a strain on your relationship. It can also lead to a court summons if allowed to continue. There are many ways to help curb your dog's barking. A few common methods are listed below. Give your dog a special toy or long-lasting treat to entertain them while you are away. Daily exercise will stimulate your dog both physically and mentally, making them a much calmer, more enjoyable pet. Ultra-sonic bark control devices are typically placed outside around the yard and emit a high-pitched sound every time the dog barks. Citronella bark collars spray an unpleasant smell towards the dog's nose every time they bark. Electronic bark collars emit a static electric charge when the dog is barking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "27   Animal Protection Please contact Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report a problem or file a complaint. Boulder Animal Protection is a division of the Boulder Police Department that enforces all city ordinances related to animals and state laws related to domestic animals. Animal Protection responds to animal-related complaints and promotes responsible pet ownership through enforcement, mediation and education. Officers investigate and respond to: roaming dogs; dangerous or aggressive animals; animal bites; cruelty and/or neglect to animals; animal noise (barking dogs); excess animal feces; leash law and tethering violations; dog licensing violations; and injured and orphaned small wildlife. Animal Rules and RegulationsThe City of Boulder's animal laws were developed to ensure the health and safety of residents and their pets. To view a complete list of all City of Boulder animal laws, review Chapter 6-1: Animals from the Boulder Revised Code. Leash lawAll dogs in the City of Boulder must be kept on leashes at all times unless they are confined to their owner's property. Dogs that roam loose present a danger to the community and may be hit by a car or attacked by other animals. An exception for your dog to run free is to utilize one of the designated off-leash dog parks. If you have obtained an Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag for your dog, you must utilize the designated opens space areas that are participating in that program. Rabies vaccinationCity of Boulder law requires all dogs and cats over the age of four months to be vaccinated against rabies. After the initial vaccination, animals must be kept current on rabies vaccinations using either a one-year or three-year vaccination. All vaccinations must be provided by a Colorado-licensed veterinarian. City of Boulder dog licenseA City of Boulder dog license is required for all dogs over the age of four months living within the city limits. The license serves as identification to enable officers to contact you if your dog is lost or injured, and to ensure that your dog is currently vaccinated against rabies. The license must be obtained within 30 days of acquiring the dog or within 30 days of moving to Boulder. In order to purchase a city dog license, a guardian must provide proof of a current rabies vaccination. All dogs are required to wear their City of Boulder dog license tag on their collar or harness at all times. Keep in mind that the Open Space & Mountain Parks Voice and Sight Tag is not a substitute for a city dog license. Aggressive animalsNo person shall own or keep any aggressive animal. An aggressive animal is one that approaches a person in a vicious or terrorizing attitude of attack. An animal that bites, claws, or attempts to bite or claw any person, or bites or injures another animal, will be considered a vicious animal. Be sure to keep your pets under control at all times to prevent an incident such as an attack or bite. Animal cruelty or neglectAll animals in Boulder are legally protected from being abandoned, beaten, tortured, injured, transported in an unsafe manner, or killed. Failure to provide adequate food, water, shelter, veterinary care, grooming, opportunity for exercise, or sanitary conditions is a violation of city ordinance. Violators will be strictly prosecuted for these infractions. Barking dog nuisance Boulder's animal noise ordinance states that it is unlawful for an owner to allow an animal to disturb the peace with loud and habitual barking, howling, whining, or baying. If you notice that your dog barks unnecessarily, it is your responsibility to identify the problem and resolve it immediately to prevent a disturbance to your neighborhood. Clean up after your animalPicking up your pet's waste is required by city ordinance. It is an important way to help preserve our environment and prevent the spread of disease. Please be courteous to other Boulder community members by cleaning up after your pet. CatsWhile not subject to leash and licensing laws, cats must be vaccinated against rabies beginning at four months of age. Cats must also be restrained from creating a nuisance by leaving feces or damaging the property of another. If a cat is causing a nuisance by defecating or destroying property, a property owner has the legal right to remove the cat from their property and bring it to the local animal shelter. The guardian may also be charged with owning a nuisance cat. Impound and board fees apply to impounded cats. Strict liability Boulder animal laws are strict liability laws. Therefore, an animal's guardian is liable even when there is no proof of negligence or intent. The guardian is responsible for their animal's actions, regardless of the circumstances, accidental or otherwise. If an animal injures, kills, or damages any person, other animal, or property, the strict liability law holds the guardian or keeper of the animal legally responsible, and includes all costs and damages incurred. PenaltiesIn addition to impoundment fees, guardians are subject to a court summons for violations of the city animal ordinances. The maximum penalty for each violation is $1,000 and/or 90 days in jail. Fines are subject to increase for subsequent violations.   \n",

       "624  The city does not pick up tree branches. However, there are several ongoing options for managing your yard waste: Residents may place any yard debris, along with food waste, for free in their curbside compost collection cart. As part of the regular compost collection, on each regularly-scheduled collection day, all haulers are required by law to also pick up (for free): Three extra bags of leaves placed outside the compost cart - AND Three additional bundles of branches - six feet long by three feet wide. If there is more than one branch in the bundle, it must be tied with non-plastic twine so it can be picked up by the collection crews and can be composted.   Residents can bring – or have someone else bring – leaves, branches and untreated, unpainted wood waste to the yard waste and wood waste drop-off center: Located at Western Disposal’s transfer station: 5880 Butte Mill Road Hours 7 AM- 5 PM Monday through Saturday Fees are approximately $6-$10 per car or truck load   Many landscapers and independent individuals with vehicles are often willing to pick up the branches and transport them to the drop-off center for you. Some residents have reported that Craigslist and Nextdoor are good places to seek low-cost hauling services. Thank you for your inquiry.

There is no minimum requirement for compost collection capacity at multi-family residential properties.• For more information about where to take items that are more difficult to dispose of visit Eco-Cycle's Center for Hard-to-Recycle Materials (CHaRM) website at www.ecocycle.org/charm• For more information about where to drop off hazardous materials, visit the Boulder County Hazardous Waste website at www.bouldercounty.org/env/hazwaste                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "631  Water Being Pumped or Diverted from One Private Property onto Another The City of Boulder does not regulate the discharge or diversion of water from one private property onto another private property. If you believe you have suffered damages or other impacts to your private property due to the activities of neighboring property owners diverting or discharging water, you may wish to consult with a private attorney to explore your legal rights. The city cannot provide legal advice to people who believe they have suffered damages due to an adjacent or nearby property owner diverting water onto a neighbor's property. If any fence, wall or berm was (or is) being constructed to divert drainage without a building permit, contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to alert an inspector of the possible violation.Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off of Private Property onto Public Property like Sidewalks, Streets or GuttersThe City of Boulder regulates the discharge or diversion of water onto public property under the Boulder Revised Code Chapter 8-2-8: Discharging Water Prohibited. Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines. To report water being pumped or diverted onto any public property such as an alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, right-of-way, or street, call 303-441-4237 or \"Make a Service Request\" below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "632  Water Seeping into BasementsThe level of groundwater (the depth below ground where the soil is saturated, also called the water table) varies throughout Boulder and some areas have a higher water table than others. Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you. If you can see the source of the water and it's bubbling or spraying up from under the ground or roadway, call 303-441-3200 from 7 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or 303-441-3249 after-hours, to report a water main (pipe) break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "633  The city maintains more than 450 miles of water pipe that serve more than 29,000 customers. The water department also maintains and services about 4,700 fire hydrants. All fire hydrant maintenance, including inspections, repairs and painting is managed by Public Works, not the Fire-Rescue Department. The water department also routinely operates valves and flushes fire hydrants to ensure reliable, high-quality, potable water service.  City water customers are advised to know the location of the water shutoff valve inside their home (different from the water meter valve) and how to shut off water in case of an emergency, such as a broken or frozen water pipe. This knowledge can help prevent extensive and expensive damage to your property. The water department's normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.  After-hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as water main breaks.To report an emergency water maintenance issue, including a city water main leak or break, please call 303-441-3200. Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.  Water customers should be aware that after a water main break, tap water may temporarily have a light brown or yellow color. The cause is typically common iron rust from inside the city water pipes.Visit the Drinking Water Quality and Discolored Water Questions page for more information.  The city also offers an interactive web map called the Water Distribution Info. Center that displays locations and live information about planned and unplanned water shutoffs, including main breaks and annual water utility projects.    For all non-emergency water maintenance issues, including fire hydrant and water meter issues, please select the \"Make a Service Request\" button below or call 303-441-3200.  Do NOT use Inquire Boulder to request utility locates prior to digging. All requests for utility locates must go through the 811 dispatch center.

The city is working with FEMA and other partners to assess and address the significant damages in these areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
