We are raising our child (now at Casey Middle School) in this community. However, I have been increasingly concerned over the past 3-4 years about the Increase in the homeless population of Boulder, which appears to have exponentially exploded. Now, where we live, we have homeless people (mostly men of dubious looking character) constantly walking by, sometimes sleeping in the trees right outside of and through our backyard, and some of the children in our neighborhood have found used needles laying around. The other night, we had a homeless person park himself in front of our front door, mumbling incoherently for over 15 minutes, and we had to call the police. The police had nothing they could do except push him back onto the trails. I had a dialogue with a police officer about this situation, and he was very angry, stating that there is not much they can do because of the city council, and urging residents to get involved. Occasionally we have passed men urinating (in open sight) in the tunnels that go under the main roads along the bike paths, and by trees outside where we live. We now stick to the bike paths and don't veer off, as multiple areas along the bike paths have become \"homes\" to the homeless, strewn with dirty clothes, plastic bags, dirty blankets/sleeping bags, trash (beer cans, food containers), drug paraphernalia and so forth. My daughter is 13 years old, and it is incredibly sad to me that I fear for her safety being alone outside, and now no longer let her walk around alone. I am very confused as to how this beautiful city allowed two homeless shelters to be put right inside the city, basically throwing the welcome mat out to the homeless, and allowing our beautiful home to essentially be trashed. I am angry. I am not unsympathetic to the plight of the (truly) homeless, and the desperate need for better care of our mentally ill. However, I fail to see how we have improved this situation through sacrificing Boulder, and our home, to this onslaught of marginalized people. I have also noticed that many of these people do not seem to want to move out of their situation, seem to prefer a vagabond lifestyle, and camp out anywhere they please. A number of homeless people have approached me asking for money, and when I offer to buy them food instead, they decline. They are not hungry; they want drugs or alcohol, and are in need of mental and drug rehabilitation. We are finally considering moving away from Boulder, because we feel this situation has become almost unbearable. I have never felt a need to express my concerns to the city until now. This is heartbreaking for me, after calling Boulder home for so many years.</td>\n",

As a high density corridor street that hundreds of people drive walk and bike along every day, as well as a corridor into Boulder that runs parallel to Foothills Pkwy, I believe the fencing should be replaced. On the foothills (east) side, the replacement fencing should ideally also serve as a buffer between the highway and the neighborhood. Additionally, the broken wire fencing currently running along the foothills/east side is a safety hazard for small children and neighborhood pets. With a highway of that intensity, I would hope residents deserve a bit of a safety and aesthetic buffer. Thanks for looking into it!</td>\n",

The issue is the contractor left all the trimmings on the side yard and only cut the trees in the alley directly behind 790 10th St. Mary is wondering if the trimmings will be picked up and the reason for removing the trees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "21    Dan is calling in reference to the alley that is right behind his house running north/south. It has several potholes and one can't drive down it without rocking dangerously from side to side. He wonders if a re-grading would be possible -- this was the action taken by the city a few years ago. He would be even more excited about the possibility of actual paving but understands if the city can't do that. Regardless, he would appreciate a call back from someone who might discuss with him what can be done.

       "22    There is a substantial and growing pothole in the bike lane on Baseline. During the construction along Baseline adjacent to Chautauqua, utility lines were run down the alley between 9th and Grant. A hole was excavated in 9th, within the bike lane, as part of this construction. The excavation was patched, though improperly, so the there has been and continues to be subsidence; creating a pothole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "25    Mary has complained several times to various city workgroups about the school flashers on 19th being blocked - she is concerned about the kids crossing on 19th and cars not being able to see school zone flashers. Can you take a look and determine if trees/shrubs blocking the lights are in the ROW or on private property? If public see if we can do anything - if private maybe BPD can enforce? Or sign/signal can prune? Mary would like a call on whether we can do anything or not Thanks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "28    There are very large rocks that have been placed on 2 corners. These rocks often move onto the pavement, they cause a real hazard for smaller cars. I think they've been put there so people don't cut the corner too close. These rocks in combination with the bushes that have been planted there and are not trimmed very often make the already dangerous turn onto Jay Rd. even more dangerous especially on cars that are low to the ground.

       "9418  The left turn signals no longer flash yellow while the light is green for traffic going straight through the light. This means that drivers need to wait through the entire light progression before they can turn again. Not only is this inefficient for fuel consumption and pollution, but it adds undue time to a trip, without adding any safety for pedestrians or bicyclists. Please fix this so that the light functions the way it has for the past 20 years. The same is true for both the 30th and Baseline lights as well as the 28th and Jay Road lights, which is even more ridiculous, considering the low traffic at that light for most of the day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "9424  I have been a resident of Boulder since 1996. I fell in love with Boulder at the time, and considered it literally a \"heaven on earth\". We are raising our child (now at Casey Middle School) in this community. However, I have been increasingly concerned over the past 3-4 years about the Increase in the homeless population of Boulder, which appears to have exponentially exploded. Now, where we live, we have homeless people (mostly men of dubious looking character) constantly walking by, sometimes sleeping in the trees right outside of and through our backyard, and some of the children in our neighborhood have found used needles laying around. The other night, we had a homeless person park himself in front of our front door, mumbling incoherently for over 15 minutes, and we had to call the police. The police had nothing they could do except push him back onto the trails. I had a dialogue with a police officer about this situation, and he was very angry, stating that there is not much they can do because of the city council, and urging residents to get involved. Occasionally we have passed men urinating (in open sight) in the tunnels that go under the main roads along the bike paths, and by trees outside where we live. We now stick to the bike paths and don't veer off, as multiple areas along the bike paths have become \"homes\" to the homeless, strewn with dirty clothes, plastic bags, dirty blankets/sleeping bags, trash (beer cans, food containers), drug paraphernalia and so forth. My daughter is 13 years old, and it is incredibly sad to me that I fear for her safety being alone outside, and now no longer let her walk around alone. I am very confused as to how this beautiful city allowed two homeless shelters to be put right inside the city, basically throwing the welcome mat out to the homeless, and allowing our beautiful home to essentially be trashed. I am angry. I am not unsympathetic to the plight of the (truly) homeless, and the desperate need for better care of our mentally ill. However, I fail to see how we have improved this situation through sacrificing Boulder, and our home, to this onslaught of marginalized people. I have also noticed that many of these people do not seem to want to move out of their situation, seem to prefer a vagabond lifestyle, and camp out anywhere they please. A number of homeless people have approached me asking for money, and when I offer to buy them food instead, they decline. They are not hungry; they want drugs or alcohol, and are in need of mental and drug rehabilitation. We are finally considering moving away from Boulder, because we feel this situation has become almost unbearable. I have never felt a need to express my concerns to the city until now. This is heartbreaking for me, after calling Boulder home for so many years.   \n",
       "9425  The (I believe city-owned) fencing along Thunderbird drive from Sioux Dr thru Thunderbird Cir is dilapidated and unattractive. This is true of the fencing on both the east/ Foothills side, and the west side of the street (running alongside the homes). As a high density corridor street that hundreds of people drive walk and bike along every day, as well as a corridor into Boulder that runs parallel to Foothills Pkwy, I believe the fencing should be replaced. On the foothills (east) side, the replacement fencing should ideally also serve as a buffer between the highway and the neighborhood. Additionally, the broken wire fencing currently running along the foothills/east side is a safety hazard for small children and neighborhood pets. With a highway of that intensity, I would hope residents deserve a bit of a safety and aesthetic buffer.

       "9437  1/2, There is a bunch of junk including furniture, cement blocks & trash behind the Valero gas station. All the debris is located behind the fence around the gas station, more specifically directly East behind the actual building. Since this area is fenced off, I think the gas station does not feel they need to monitor or clean this area. But it is becoming a trash heap and possibly homeless living back there. Can the city please investigate this area & enforce the city trash guidelines. If the gas station could keep this area clean on a regular basis that would also be great.

       "6   Hello, There are a group of Gambel Oak Trees with Tree ID #'s 38820-38825 that I would like to be pruned up in order to keep them away from the Rec Center wall and to keep them in good, trimmed health. I also would like Tree ID 38825 to be pruned away from the American Flag so it will not come in contact with the tree, from the nearby flag pole. Thank you very much and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to give me a call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "      <td>Frozen water pipes can be avoided with a little planning and a few simple steps. When frigid arctic air hits, water freezes, and as it freezes, it expands -- causing pipes to burst and possibly flood. Pipes that freeze most frequently are those that are exposed to severe cold, such as outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, water sprinkler lines and water supply pipes in unheated interior areas such as basements and crawl spaces, attics, garages or kitchen cabinets. Pipes that run against exterior walls that have little or no insulation are also subject to freezing. Determine where the water shut-off valve is in the house and how to use it in case pipes freeze and break. Boulder's Fire Department recommends that every member of a household know this information and similar to a fire drill, practice turning the valve off and on. To determine where a water shut-off valve is, locate the outside water line that leads to the residence. The water line usually flows directly from the water meter to a location inside the residence. Likely places for the water turn-off valve include internal pipes running against exterior walls or where water service enters a home through the foundation. Before the onset of cold weather, prevent freezing of water supply lines: Drain water from swimming pool and water sprinkler supply lines following manufacturer's or installer's directions. Do not put antifreeze in these lines unless directed. Antifreeze is environmentally harmful and is dangerous to humans, pets, wildlife and landscaping. Remove, drain and carefully store hoses used outdoors. Close inside valves supplying outdoor hose bibs. Open the outside hose taps to allow water to drain. Keep the outside valve open so that any water remaining in the pipe can expand without causing the pipe to break. Check around the home for other areas where water supply lines are located in unheated areas. Look in the basement, crawl space, attic, garage, and under kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Both hot and cold water pipes in these areas should be insulated. A hot water supply line can freeze just as a cold water supply line can freeze if water is not running through the pipe, and the water temperature becomes cold. Consider installing specific products made to insulate water pipes like a \"pipe sleeve\" or installing UL-listed \"heat tape,\" \"heat cable,\" or similar materials on exposed water pipes. Many products are available at a building supplies retailer. Pipes should be carefully wrapped, with ends butted tightly and joints wrapped with tape. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for installing and using these products. Newspaper can provide some degree of insulation and protection to exposed pipes. During cold weather, take preventive action Keep garage doors closed if there are water supply lines in the garage. Open kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children. When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip (at a minimal amount) from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe, even at a trickle, helps prevent frozen pipes. During extreme cold, keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night. If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat set to a temperature no lower than 55oF. Thaw frozen pipes If your house or basement is flooding, turn off the water valve and call 911. If there is no flooding but you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, make sure your main water valve is turned on. If it is, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the suspected frozen area of the water pipe. As you treat the frozen pipe and the frozen area begins to melt, water will begin to flow through the frozen area. Running water through the pipe will help melt more ice in the pipe. Apply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, electric hair dryer, a portable space heater (kept away from flammable materials), or by wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove or other open flame device. Make sure a heating pad, hair dryer or other electrical devices do not come into contact with water. Keep the faucet open. Apply heat until full water pressure is restored. If you are unable to locate the frozen area, if the frozen area is not accessible or if you cannot thaw the pipe, call a licensed plumber. Check all other faucets in your home to find out if you have additional frozen pipes. If one pipe freezes, others may also freeze. Future Protection: Consider relocating exposed pipes to provide increased protection from freezing. For example, if the home is being remodeled, a professional can relocate pipes. To maintain higher temperatures, add insulation to attics, basements and crawl spaces. For more information about frozen pipes, contact a licensed plumber or building professional.</td>\n",

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",

You can see some dog owners do not even pick their dog shit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8   I parked in the garage on 11th and Walnut on Sunday 12/23 starting at 5 PM and left at 12:35 AM that Monday 12/24. I was charged $1.25 but it should have still been free since charged parking doesnâ€™t start till 7 AM on Mondays , I park here all the time and I am confused as to why it says I owed $1.25.

       "0   In some cases, the CPW will reimburse agricultural producers for damage caused by big game, including bears, to their agricultural product or means of production.

The reimbursement process is governed by state statutes and regulations and does not apply to personal property, including fences, garages, cars, or most other objects that a bear might damage within the Boulder city limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Several shuttle services and a public bus service (RTD SkyRide) provide ground transportation between Denver International Airport and the Boulder area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "12  Frozen water pipes can be avoided with a little planning and a few simple steps. When frigid arctic air hits, water freezes, and as it freezes, it expands -- causing pipes to burst and possibly flood. Pipes that freeze most frequently are those that are exposed to severe cold, such as outdoor hose bibs, swimming pool supply lines, water sprinkler lines and water supply pipes in unheated interior areas such as basements and crawl spaces, attics, garages or kitchen cabinets. Pipes that run against exterior walls that have little or no insulation are also subject to freezing. Determine where the water shut-off valve is in the house and how to use it in case pipes freeze and break. Boulder's Fire Department recommends that every member of a household know this information and similar to a fire drill, practice turning the valve off and on. To determine where a water shut-off valve is, locate the outside water line that leads to the residence. The water line usually flows directly from the water meter to a location inside the residence. Likely places for the water turn-off valve include internal pipes running against exterior walls or where water service enters a home through the foundation. Before the onset of cold weather, prevent freezing of water supply lines: Drain water from swimming pool and water sprinkler supply lines following manufacturer's or installer's directions. Do not put antifreeze in these lines unless directed. Antifreeze is environmentally harmful and is dangerous to humans, pets, wildlife and landscaping. Remove, drain and carefully store hoses used outdoors. Close inside valves supplying outdoor hose bibs. Open the outside hose taps to allow water to drain. Keep the outside valve open so that any water remaining in the pipe can expand without causing the pipe to break. Check around the home for other areas where water supply lines are located in unheated areas. Look in the basement, crawl space, attic, garage, and under kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Both hot and cold water pipes in these areas should be insulated. A hot water supply line can freeze just as a cold water supply line can freeze if water is not running through the pipe, and the water temperature becomes cold. Consider installing specific products made to insulate water pipes like a \"pipe sleeve\" or installing UL-listed \"heat tape,\" \"heat cable,\" or similar materials on exposed water pipes. Many products are available at a building supplies retailer. Pipes should be carefully wrapped, with ends butted tightly and joints wrapped with tape. Follow manufacturer's recommendations for installing and using these products. Newspaper can provide some degree of insulation and protection to exposed pipes. During cold weather, take preventive action Keep garage doors closed if there are water supply lines in the garage. Open kitchen and bathroom cabinet doors to allow warmer air to circulate around the plumbing. Be sure to move any harmful cleaners and household chemicals out of the reach of children. When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip (at a minimal amount) from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe, even at a trickle, helps prevent frozen pipes. During extreme cold, keep the thermostat set to the same temperature both during the day and at night. If you will be going away during cold weather, leave the heat set to a temperature no lower than 55oF. Thaw frozen pipes If your house or basement is flooding, turn off the water valve and call 911. If there is no flooding but you turn on a faucet and only a trickle comes out, make sure your main water valve is turned on. If it is, suspect a frozen pipe. Locate the suspected frozen area of the water pipe. As you treat the frozen pipe and the frozen area begins to melt, water will begin to flow through the frozen area. Running water through the pipe will help melt more ice in the pipe. Apply heat to the section of pipe using an electric heating pad wrapped around the pipe, electric hair dryer, a portable space heater (kept away from flammable materials), or by wrapping pipes with towels soaked in hot water. Do not use a blowtorch, kerosene or propane heater, charcoal stove or other open flame device. Make sure a heating pad, hair dryer or other electrical devices do not come into contact with water. Keep the faucet open. Apply heat until full water pressure is restored. If you are unable to locate the frozen area, if the frozen area is not accessible or if you cannot thaw the pipe, call a licensed plumber. Check all other faucets in your home to find out if you have additional frozen pipes. If one pipe freezes, others may also freeze. Future Protection: Consider relocating exposed pipes to provide increased protection from freezing. For example, if the home is being remodeled, a professional can relocate pipes. To maintain higher temperatures, add insulation to attics, basements and crawl spaces. For more information about frozen pipes, contact a licensed plumber or building professional.  \n",
