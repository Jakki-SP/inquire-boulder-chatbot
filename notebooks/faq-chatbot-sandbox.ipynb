       "6   Hello, There are a group of Gambel Oak Trees with Tree ID #'s 38820-38825 that I would like to be pruned up in order to keep them away from the Rec Center wall and to keep them in good, trimmed health. I also would like Tree ID 38825 to be pruned away from the American Flag so it will not come in contact with the tree, from the nearby flag pole. Thank you very much and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to give me a call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.</td>\n",

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",

You can see some dog owners do not even pick their dog shit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8   I parked in the garage on 11th and Walnut on Sunday 12/23 starting at 5 PM and left at 12:35 AM that Monday 12/24. I was charged $1.25 but it should have still been free since charged parking doesnâ€™t start till 7 AM on Mondays , I park here all the time and I am confused as to why it says I owed $1.25.

The 3 percent solution may be used with HomeWorks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "18     What is the city's role in airport operations? The city is responsible for the safe and efficient operation and maintenance of the airport. The city works to balance the impacts of airport operations and the needs of airport users with the needs of the community. To do this, the city controls land use around the Boulder Municipal Airport and dictates procedures for aircraft operations on the ground (aircraft in the air are regulated by the FAA).

       "28     How can I deal with a barking dog? If a dog is causing a nuisance and disturbing your peace, there are some steps you can follow to help resolve the issue. The first step to take is to try and talk with your neighbor. Many people are unaware that their dog barks when they are absent. They may not be aware that their dog's barking is bothering you. Speaking with the dog guardian often solves the problem. If you are uncomfortable speaking with your neighbor, a polite note placed on the front door or mailed to the address can help make them aware of the problem. While the city does recommend trying to solve the dispute with your neighbor to reach an amiable solution on your own, speaking with your neighbor is a suggestion and not a requirement when dealing with barking dogs. If attempting to address the barking dog problem on your own fails, call the Boulder Police Animal Protection at 303-441-3333 to report the problem. Be prepared to provide Animal Protection with the following information: the address of the barking dog; exact date(s) and time(s) of the barking, preferably the most recent occurrence; and a description of the dog(s), if you can provide one. The City of Boulder has a two-step process when dealing with nuisance dogs. Once you have provided the necessary information, Boulder Police Animal Protection will contact the dog's guardian and issue a written warning. Animal Protection will meet with the guardian in person to help them identify what is causing the barking and try to find a solution. In accordance with city ordinance, a written warning must be issued prior to a summons being served. After the warning is issued, give the guardian 10 to 14 days to identify the cause and possible resolutions to the nuisance barking. Many times, guardians need to utilize trial and error to discover which bark-control methods work best for their dog If the written warning is not successful and additional enforcement action must be taken, two reporting parties are required for a court summons to be issued. The reporting parties will need to complete witness statements for the same date/time/duration for a court summons to be issued.                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "29     Why do dogs bark? Dogs bark for many reasons, and determining what causes the barking is the first tool to begin to resolve the problem behavior. Some common reasons that dogs bark are listed below. Boredom/loneliness - Dogs are pack animals, are not solitary, and do not like to be left alone. They need a lot of attention and stimulation. Territorial/protection - Dogs will bark at people or animals that come near their territory to get them to leave. This can often appear to be aggressive behavior. Separation anxiety - Dogs with separation anxiety often bark excessively when left alone. Dogs who have separation anxiety will often pace and exhibit destructive behavior. Alarm/fear - Some dogs will bark at anything that startles them or catches their attention. There are many things throughout a day that may startle a dog. Be a good neighbor. A barking dog can be disruptive to your neighbors and can put a strain on your relationship. It can also lead to a court summons if allowed to continue. There are many ways to help curb your dog's barking. A few common methods are listed below. Give your dog a special toy or long-lasting treat to entertain them while you are away. Daily exercise will stimulate your dog both physically and mentally, making them a much calmer, more enjoyable pet. Ultra-sonic bark control devices are typically placed outside around the yard and emit a high-pitched sound every time the dog barks. Citronella bark collars spray an unpleasant smell towards the dog's nose every time they bark. Electronic bark collars emit a static electric charge when the dog is barking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "660    Tree Branch Pick-Up The city does not pick up tree branches. However, there are several ongoing options for managing your yard waste: Residents may place any yard debris, along with food waste, for free in their curbside compost collection cart. As part of the regular compost collection, on each regularly-scheduled collection day, all haulers are required by law to also pick up (for free): Three extra bags of leaves placed outside the compost cart - AND Three additional bundles of branches - six feet long by three feet wide. If there is more than one branch in the bundle, it must be tied with non-plastic twine so it can be picked up by the collection crews and can be composted.

Failure to pay wages cases are handled by the city's Office of Human Rights. Most cases are resolved through facilitation or mediation. Cases that are not resolved may be prosecuted in the Boulder Municipal Court. If you believe that your employer may be in violation of this ordinance, please contact Community Relations and Office of Human Rights at 303-441-3140.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "667    Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off Private Property to Elsewhere Water Being Pumped or Diverted from One Private Property onto Another The City of Boulder does not regulate the discharge or diversion of water from one private property onto another private property. If you believe you have suffered damages or other impacts to your private property due to the activities of neighboring property owners diverting or discharging water, you may wish to consult with a private attorney to explore your legal rights. The city cannot provide legal advice to people who believe they have suffered damages due to an adjacent or nearby property owner diverting water onto a neighbor's property. If any fence, wall or berm was (or is) being constructed to divert drainage without a building permit, contact the city's Planning and Development Services Center at plandevelop@bouldercolorado.gov to alert an inspector of the possible violation. Water Being Pumped or Diverted Off of Private Property onto Public Property like Sidewalks, Streets or GuttersThe City of Boulder regulates the discharge or diversion of water onto public property under the Boulder Revised Code Chapter 8-2-8: Discharging Water Prohibited. Typically, property owners that are using a sump pump to discharge groundwater onto any sidewalk, street, alley, or other public right-of-way are in violation of city code and subject to fines. To report water being pumped or diverted onto any public property such as an alley, sidewalk, gutter, storm drain, right-of-way, or street, call 303-441-4237 or \"Make a Service Request\" below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "668    Water Seepage Water Seeping into BasementsThe level of groundwater (the depth below ground where the soil is saturated, also called the water table) varies throughout Boulder and some areas have a higher water table than others. Following the rainfall that occurred between Sept. 11 and 15, 2013, groundwater levels are higher than usual and are expected to remain high for a while. Due to high groundwater levels, some property owners may continue to experience water seeping into their basements, and those homes and buildings that have sump pumps may notice that they are running more than usual. Private property owners should address these issues themselves by working with experienced professionals to repair damages or prevent further seepage into their buildings and by coordinating with their insurance companies to see if they are covered for damages that may have occurred. If you experience new instances of clear-ish water seeping into your building (that isn't a continuation of issues that began during the September 2013 flood), first check the Water Distribution Information Center Interactive Map for real-time information about known water main breaks near you. If you can see the source of the water and it's bubbling or spraying up from under the ground or roadway, call 303-441-3200 from 7 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, or 303-441-3249 after-hours, to report a water main (pipe) break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "669    Water System Maintenance The city maintains more than 450 miles of water pipe that serve more than 29,000 customers. The water department also maintains and services about 4,700 fire hydrants. All fire hydrant maintenance, including inspections, repairs and painting is managed by Public Works, not the Fire-Rescue Department. The water department also routinely operates valves and flushes fire hydrants to ensure reliable, high-quality, potable water service.   City water customers are advised to know the location of the water shutoff valve inside their home (different from the water meter valve) and how to shut off water in case of an emergency, such as a broken or frozen water pipe. This knowledge can help prevent extensive and expensive damage to your property. The water department's normal business hours are 7 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.   After-hours staff respond to true emergency events, such as water main breaks. To report an emergency water maintenance issue, including a city water main leak or break, please call 303-441-3200. Please report all emergency issues by phone (do NOT make an online service request) to ensure a prioritized response by city staff.   Water customers should be aware that after a water main break, tap water may temporarily have a light brown or yellow color. The cause is typically common iron rust from inside the city water pipes. Visit the Drinking Water Quality and Discolored Water Questions page for more information.   The city also offers an interactive web map called the Water Distribution Info. Center that displays locations and live information about planned and unplanned water shutoffs, including main breaks and annual water utility projects.

In addition, the Boulder city manager may designate \"no burn\" days when monitoring indicates actual or potential violations of air quality standards established by either the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, or when meteorological conditions warrant such designation. Wood Burning Restrictions 6-9-3(c) Residents may not burn solid fuel devices during a declared \"no burn\" day unless: The person had obtained a temporary exemption demonstrating both an economic need to burn solid fuel for building space heating purposes and a reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. The city manager may grant such exemptions according to the following standards. A person applying for an exemption must demonstrate economic need by certifying eligibility for energy assistance according to economic guidelines established by the United States Office of Management and Budget under the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP), as administered by Boulder County. A person applying for an exemption must sign a verified affidavit demonstrating reliance on a solid fuel burning device as the primary source of heat. An exemption obtained under this section shall be effective for one year from the date it is granted. A power outage, interruption of natural gas supply, or temporary equipment failure existed at the time and location of the violation that did not result from any action of the person charged with the violation. The burning occurred in a EPA-certified wood stove or in a solid fuel burning device that meets the same emission standards as are required for a Phase III-certified wood stove and is tested by an EPA-accredited laboratory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
