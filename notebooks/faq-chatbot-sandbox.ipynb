       "6   Hello, There are a group of Gambel Oak Trees with Tree ID #'s 38820-38825 that I would like to be pruned up in order to keep them away from the Rec Center wall and to keep them in good, trimmed health. I also would like Tree ID 38825 to be pruned away from the American Flag so it will not come in contact with the tree, from the nearby flag pole.

Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.</td>\n",

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",

       "6   Hello, There are a group of Gambel Oak Trees with Tree ID #'s 38820-38825 that I would like to be pruned up in order to keep them away from the Rec Center wall and to keep them in good, trimmed health. I also would like Tree ID 38825 to be pruned away from the American Flag so it will not come in contact with the tree, from the nearby flag pole. Thank you very much and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to give me a call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7   There are constantly dogs off leash in the children playgrounds of columbine school. Even though the playgrounds are fenced and have a sign stating dogs should not go in. You can see some dog owners do not even pick their dog shit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8   I parked in the garage on 11th and Walnut on Sunday 12/23 starting at 5 PM and left at 12:35 AM that Monday 12/24. I was charged $1.25 but it should have still been free since charged parking doesnâ€™t start till 7 AM on Mondays , I park here all the time and I am confused as to why it says I owed $1.25. Is there a glitch in the system ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

You may choose to pay the fine, which means you are not contesting the violation, or you may come to court to contest your citation. You may also Contact the Boulder Municipal Court to speak with a court clerk. Pay a Photo Enforcement TicketOnline, phone, mail or drop-off payments are encouraged. Nominating the actual driver If you are not the driver pictured, you have the option to identify the actual driver. Complete the form on the reverse side of the letter. You must include the full mailing address for the nominated person in order for the nomination to be accepted. Return the completed form with a legible photo copy of your driver's license in the envelope provided by the response date. Corresponding with the Boulder Municipal Court regarding your Notice of Violation Written correspondence may be received by mail, fax, or in person. Contact the Boulder Municipal Court. All written correspondence must include a legible photo copy of your driver's license. To contest the violation, follow the directions on the back of your Photo Enforcement letter or follow the instructions below for setting a Photo Enforcement case for court. For all other correspondence by mail, complete the Photo Enforcement Correspondence and Guilty Plea form. Setting a Photo Enforcement case for court You may appear in person at the Boulder Municipal Court counter to set your case for a future arraignment date (a trial date can be set once you are advised of your rights and enter a formal plea at arraignment) or fill out the online form here. If you appear in person: Bring your driver's license (a copy will be made for the court file). Bring a copy of the Notice of Violation you received. By setting your case for court, you will be waiving personal service and will be required to sign a form stating such. Court costs are not assessed on Photo Enforcement cases. Failure to appear for court is a separate violation that may result in a warrant being issued for your arrest. Failure to appear for court will default a guilty finding, assess applicable fines, and result in the referral of your case to a collection agency, which increases the amount due by 25 percent. Failure to respond to a photo enforcement citationFailure to respond to the photo enforcement citation by the date on the Notice of Violation, either by paying the fine or appearing in court, can result in additional fees and penalties. A late fee is not assessed after the due date, but the violation will be reviewed for personal service by the City of Boulder Police Department. Served in person (SIP) Cases that are served in person are assessed an additional $60 SIP fee once a summons has been served by a police officer. You may pay the amount due (including SIP fee) prior to the assigned court date or you must appear in court as scheduled. SIP fees will not be waived simply because your address has changed. State laws require you to update your address with your Boulder County Clerk and Recorder's Motor Vehicle Division whenever you move.
