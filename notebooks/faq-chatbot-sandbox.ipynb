       "6   Hello, There are a group of Gambel Oak Trees with Tree ID #'s 38820-38825 that I would like to be pruned up in order to keep them away from the Rec Center wall and to keep them in good, trimmed health. I also would like Tree ID 38825 to be pruned away from the American Flag so it will not come in contact with the tree, from the nearby flag pole.

Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.</td>\n",

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",

Thank you very much and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to give me a call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "7   There are constantly dogs off leash in the children playgrounds of columbine school. Even though the playgrounds are fenced and have a sign stating dogs should not go in. You can see some dog owners do not even pick their dog shit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8   I parked in the garage on 11th and Walnut on Sunday 12/23 starting at 5 PM and left at 12:35 AM that Monday 12/24. I was charged $1.25 but it should have still been free since charged parking doesnâ€™t start till 7 AM on Mondays , I park here all the time and I am confused as to why it says I owed $1.25. Is there a glitch in the system ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",

Dog guardians must have a leash for each dog in their possession. Aggressive animals are prohibited. Dog guardians are responsible for obeying all park rules. The city recommends that puppies under four months old not use the dog park because they have not yet received their full inoculations to protect them from parvo-virus and other diseases. Female dogs in heat can cause dog fights and aggressive behavior. Please leave your female dog at home during periods of intense heat. Aggression in dogs can increase when they are leashed, especially when encountered by off-leash dogs. Please evaluate your dogs prior to bringing them to the dog park, ensuring that they are well-socialized so that they can be off leash in this area. At no time should you bring more than four dogs to a dog park - this is beyond the possible \"span of control\" to ensure a safe and happy experience for everyone. Please consider how many dogs are using the dog park before you bring your own dogs inside. You might consider adjusting your schedule if you have multiple dogs so that other visitors are not overwhelmed. The double gate is provided for your dog's safety. Please make sure you close the first gate entirely before you open the second gate so that the dog is in a safe enclosure during the transition from leash to off-leash. Dogs differ in their tolerance of other dogs playing with their toys or food. Please look around and coordinate with other visitors to make sure that a thrown toy does not start a fight.

       "2    Graffiti The City of Boulder has a strict graffiti ordinance. Commercial or rental property owners are responsible for taking measures to prevent and remove graffiti within three days of noticing it. If the graffiti is not removed, the property owner will receive a warning notice that a summons will be issued for continued non-compliance. If the graffiti remains after a warning is given, the property owner will receive a summons. A first-time summons is $250, which can be mailed in. The maximum violation penalty is $1,000 and 90 days in jail. For graffiti removal tips, visit the city's Graffiti Removal Program. If you witness a vandal in the act of graffiti tagging, please call 911. To report a graffiti crime on your property, call the Boulder Police at 303-441-3333. A reward of up to $1,000 is available for information leading to the arrest of a vandal. To request graffiti removal, to report graffiti on city or private property, or to request more information, please fill out the form below. In the description, please indicate if you know whether it's public or private property.

       "11   Why do I have to to pay an impound fee to both the court and the tow company? The city incurs expenses associated with the impound and towing of your vehicle, including police officer and staff time. Boulder Revised Code Section 2-6-7 authorizes the court to pass along these costs to the owner of the vehicle. The towing company also incurs expenses in towing the vehicle to the tow yard, and is authorized by its contract with the city to pass that cost along to the registered owner of the vehicle.

       "12   Why are disposable checkout bags a problem? Boulder currently uses approximately 33 million checkout bags a year, or about 342 bags/person/year. Plastic bags are produced from non-renewable resources, are difficult to recycle (they cannot go in Boulder's curbside bins), and contaminate our recycling facility equipment. Plastic bags do not biodegrade, so they remain as litter in the environment. Paper bags are recyclable, but take a very large amount of water and energy to produce. The disposable bag fee helps mitigate these problems by charging a fee to consumers that choose to use disposable bags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "13   Why can't CPW take all of the bears out of town and keep them out? There is no simple way to keep bears out of the city. Because abundant, high-quality habitat exists around the City of Boulder, there will always be bears in town to some extent. In some cases, bears in Boulder may be relocated, though this often is not an ideal solution. Young bears may be somewhat more likely to stay in the area they are moved to. There are, as of yet, no proven techniques to exclude bears from large areas like Boulder, though minimizing human attractants and food sources does help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "18   Drinking Water Quality Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, signed into law in 1986, empower the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine and set standards for potential contaminants to drinking water. The EPA requires local agencies to enforce these standards in their jurisdictions. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) is the regulating agency for Colorado. For more information, view the Drinking Water Quality Frequently Asked Questions. Discolored WaterRunning several taps with cold water at full force for a short period may help flush the discolored water out of your system. A general recommendation is to run the taps for five minutes. If the water is not clear, wait for half an hour before running them for five minutes again. If you have additional questions, please call the Drinking Water Program at 303-441-3200.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "19   Will CPW pay for property damage caused by bears? In some cases, the CPW will reimburse agricultural producers for damage caused by big game, including bears, to their agricultural product or means of production. The reimbursement process is governed by state statutes and regulations and does not apply to personal property, including fences, garages, cars, or most other objects that a bear might damage within the Boulder city limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Phase II of the Living Lab pilot projects is intended to evaluate whether repurposing lanes on some streets will enhance travel safety. Folsom Street provides an opportunity test street design techniques that are used across the country and solicit community input about what is - or is not - a good fit for Boulder. Your experience is a vital component of the Living Lab evaluation process. City staff is also observing conditions and gathering travel data from along Folsom and adjacent streets, and is comparing this information with baseline data from the previous street conditions. All community feedback and travel data for the Folsom Street Living Lab is being posted on www. BoulderLivingLab.net as it is collected and evaluated. On Aug. 25, 2015, City Council will review the community feedback, field observations, and travel data to evaluate whether the Folsom Street Living Lab is an effective way to help achieve the community's transportation goals. At that time, staff will seek City Council's feedback on the next steps proposed for Folsom Street and the scope and timing of potential future Living Labs. \" Make a Service Request\" to share your experience and let the city know how the Folsom Street Living Lab affects your ability to get around Boulder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "27   Dog Parks and Dog Swimming Dog Park Information:  The City of Boulder has four dog parks: East Boulder Dog Park; Foothills Dog Park; Howard Hueston Dog Park; and Valmont Dog Park. Dog park rules and etiquette All City of Boulder ordinances apply in dog parks. Dog guardians must be present within the fenced enclosure and are responsible and liable for the behavior of their dogs at all times. Dog guardians are responsible for cleaning up and properly disposing of dog waste. Dogs must be currently vaccinated and display either a city or county dog license. Dog guardians must have a leash for each dog in their possession. Aggressive animals are prohibited. Dog guardians are responsible for obeying all park rules. The city recommends that puppies under four months old not use the dog park because they have not yet received their full inoculations to protect them from parvo-virus and other diseases. Female dogs in heat can cause dog fights and aggressive behavior. Please leave your female dog at home during periods of intense heat. Aggression in dogs can increase when they are leashed, especially when encountered by off-leash dogs. Please evaluate your dogs prior to bringing them to the dog park, ensuring that they are well-socialized so that they can be off leash in this area. At no time should you bring more than four dogs to a dog park - this is beyond the possible \"span of control\" to ensure a safe and happy experience for everyone. Please consider how many dogs are using the dog park before you bring your own dogs inside. You might consider adjusting your schedule if you have multiple dogs so that other visitors are not overwhelmed. The double gate is provided for your dog's safety. Please make sure you close the first gate entirely before you open the second gate so that the dog is in a safe enclosure during the transition from leash to off-leash. Dogs differ in their tolerance of other dogs playing with their toys or food. Please look around and coordinate with other visitors to make sure that a thrown toy does not start a fight. Minimize loud noises (such as dogs barking or humans shouting) so that you do not disrupt others. Be considerate of other visitors' needs and concerns. People may be using the fenced area to train their dogs as well as play with them. Dogs may also be older, fragile or sick. Greet, then meet! Dog swimming during Dog Dayz:Scott Carpenter Pool turns into an aquatic dog park for two weeks in September. The pool closes for human use and we open up the water for dogs to enjoy.   \n",
       "28   Why are there bears in Boulder? The land surrounding Boulder, including Open Space and Mountain Parks, U.S. Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties, and the mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for bears. Bears find food in the form of garbage, compost, bird seed, barbecue grills, pet food, and fruit from trees. There is an abundance of water from various creeks, ditches, wetlands and backyard water features (fountains and ponds).

       "663  What do prairie dogs eat and how does it impact the landscape? Prairie dogs feed on a variety of vegetation, including grasses and, to a lesser extent, seeds and insects. Grasses and other vegetation are clipped close to the ground to allow for a greater range of sight. Burrowing and feeding prairie dogs affect prairie ecosystems by: modifying the physical structure and nutrient composition of the soil; causing changes in plant species composition and density by clipping foliage and roots; and providing breeding or resting sites for a variety of other species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "667  Are there limitations to where medical marijuana businesses are allowed? Yes. In general: Medical marijuana businesses (like any business) will only be issued a license if it qualifies as a use permitted in the specific zone district. Medical marijuana centers are considered \"personal service\" uses under the city's land use code and are permitted in the city Business (\"B\") zones and the city's Downtown zoned (\"D\"). There is also \"greenhouse/nursery,\" or \"manufacturing\" uses with specific permitted zone districts. For all use and zoning definitions see BRC Section 9-16, \"Definitions,\" of the Boulder Revised Code.

       "669  What are the risks to humans from bears? During the last several decades, there have been three fatalities and 37 incidents in which a person was injured by a black bear in Colorado. Many of these incidents involved the bear either being intentionally fed or being unintentionally habituated to people. There are many things you can do to lower the risk of injury from bears, including removing any attractants around your home and staying alert and aware when you are in any forest, park, or open space area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Please see the example certificate of insurance on the website to ensure you have the proper required coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "673  Discrimination The City of Boulder human rights ordinance is a local law that protects against illegal discrimination within the city limits of Boulder. The ordinance specifically affords legal protection against discrimination in three areas: housing; employment; and public accommodation. Within these three areas, the ordinance prohibits discrimination based on ancestry, color, creed, gender variance, genetic characteristics, marital status, mental disability, physical disability, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation.

       "2    The City of Boulder has a strict graffiti ordinance. Commercial or rental property owners are responsible for taking measures to prevent and remove graffiti within three days of noticing it. If the graffiti is not removed, the property owner will receive a warning notice that a summons will be issued for continued non-compliance. If the graffiti remains after a warning is given, the property owner will receive a summons. A first-time summons is $250, which can be mailed in. The maximum violation penalty is $1,000 and 90 days in jail. For graffiti removal tips, visit the city's Graffiti Removal Program. If you witness a vandal in the act of graffiti tagging, please call 911. To report a graffiti crime on your property, call the Boulder Police at 303-441-3333.

       "12   Boulder currently uses approximately 33 million checkout bags a year, or about 342 bags/person/year. Plastic bags are produced from non-renewable resources, are difficult to recycle (they cannot go in Boulder's curbside bins), and contaminate our recycling facility equipment. Plastic bags do not biodegrade, so they remain as litter in the environment. Paper bags are recyclable, but take a very large amount of water and energy to produce. The disposable bag fee helps mitigate these problems by charging a fee to consumers that choose to use disposable bags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "13   There is no simple way to keep bears out of the city. Because abundant, high-quality habitat exists around the City of Boulder, there will always be bears in town to some extent. In some cases, bears in Boulder may be relocated, though this often is not an ideal solution. Young bears may be somewhat more likely to stay in the area they are moved to. There are, as of yet, no proven techniques to exclude bears from large areas like Boulder, though minimizing human attractants and food sources does help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "18   Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, signed into law in 1986, empower the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine and set standards for potential contaminants to drinking water. The EPA requires local agencies to enforce these standards in their jurisdictions. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) is the regulating agency for Colorado. For more information, view the Drinking Water Quality Frequently Asked Questions. Discolored WaterRunning several taps with cold water at full force for a short period may help flush the discolored water out of your system. A general recommendation is to run the taps for five minutes. If the water is not clear, wait for half an hour before running them for five minutes again. If you have additional questions, please call the Drinking Water Program at 303-441-3200.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "19   In some cases, the CPW will reimburse agricultural producers for damage caused by big game, including bears, to their agricultural product or means of production. The reimbursement process is governed by state statutes and regulations and does not apply to personal property, including fences, garages, cars, or most other objects that a bear might damage within the Boulder city limits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "24   The temporary changes to Folsom Street are part of the city's Living Lab program, which is an action item from the recent update to Boulder's Transportation Master Plan. Phase II of the Living Lab pilot projects is intended to evaluate whether repurposing lanes on some streets will enhance travel safety. Folsom Street provides an opportunity test street design techniques that are used across the country and solicit community input about what is - or is not - a good fit for Boulder. Your experience is a vital component of the Living Lab evaluation process. City staff is also observing conditions and gathering travel data from along Folsom and adjacent streets, and is comparing this information with baseline data from the previous street conditions. All community feedback and travel data for the Folsom Street Living Lab is being posted on www. BoulderLivingLab.net as it is collected and evaluated. On Aug. 25, 2015, City Council will review the community feedback, field observations, and travel data to evaluate whether the Folsom Street Living Lab is an effective way to help achieve the community's transportation goals. At that time, staff will seek City Council's feedback on the next steps proposed for Folsom Street and the scope and timing of potential future Living Labs. \" Make a Service Request\" to share your experience and let the city know how the Folsom Street Living Lab affects your ability to get around Boulder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "27   Dog Park Information:  The City of Boulder has four dog parks: East Boulder Dog Park; Foothills Dog Park; Howard Hueston Dog Park; and Valmont Dog Park. Dog park rules and etiquette All City of Boulder ordinances apply in dog parks. Dog guardians must be present within the fenced enclosure and are responsible and liable for the behavior of their dogs at all times. Dog guardians are responsible for cleaning up and properly disposing of dog waste. Dogs must be currently vaccinated and display either a city or county dog license. Dog guardians must have a leash for each dog in their possession. Aggressive animals are prohibited. Dog guardians are responsible for obeying all park rules. The city recommends that puppies under four months old not use the dog park because they have not yet received their full inoculations to protect them from parvo-virus and other diseases. Female dogs in heat can cause dog fights and aggressive behavior. Please leave your female dog at home during periods of intense heat. Aggression in dogs can increase when they are leashed, especially when encountered by off-leash dogs. Please evaluate your dogs prior to bringing them to the dog park, ensuring that they are well-socialized so that they can be off leash in this area. At no time should you bring more than four dogs to a dog park - this is beyond the possible \"span of control\" to ensure a safe and happy experience for everyone. Please consider how many dogs are using the dog park before you bring your own dogs inside. You might consider adjusting your schedule if you have multiple dogs so that other visitors are not overwhelmed. The double gate is provided for your dog's safety. Please make sure you close the first gate entirely before you open the second gate so that the dog is in a safe enclosure during the transition from leash to off-leash. Dogs differ in their tolerance of other dogs playing with their toys or food. Please look around and coordinate with other visitors to make sure that a thrown toy does not start a fight. Minimize loud noises (such as dogs barking or humans shouting) so that you do not disrupt others. Be considerate of other visitors' needs and concerns. People may be using the fenced area to train their dogs as well as play with them. Dogs may also be older, fragile or sick. Greet, then meet! Dog swimming during Dog Dayz:Scott Carpenter Pool turns into an aquatic dog park for two weeks in September. The pool closes for human use and we open up the water for dogs to enjoy.  \n",
       "28   The land surrounding Boulder, including Open Space and Mountain Parks, U.S. Forest Service property, Boulder County Open Space properties, and the mountain subdivisions all provide excellent habitat for bears. Bears find food in the form of garbage, compost, bird seed, barbecue grills, pet food, and fruit from trees. There is an abundance of water from various creeks, ditches, wetlands and backyard water features (fountains and ponds).

       "663  Prairie dogs feed on a variety of vegetation, including grasses and, to a lesser extent, seeds and insects. Grasses and other vegetation are clipped close to the ground to allow for a greater range of sight. Burrowing and feeding prairie dogs affect prairie ecosystems by: modifying the physical structure and nutrient composition of the soil; causing changes in plant species composition and density by clipping foliage and roots; and providing breeding or resting sites for a variety of other species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

This service will allow anyone with a smartphone, Wi-Fi enabled computer or tablet to access the Internet without incurring data usage charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "673  The City of Boulder human rights ordinance is a local law that protects against illegal discrimination within the city limits of Boulder. The ordinance specifically affords legal protection against discrimination in three areas: housing; employment; and public accommodation. Within these three areas, the ordinance prohibits discrimination based on ancestry, color, creed, gender variance, genetic characteristics, marital status, mental disability, physical disability, race, religion, sex and sexual orientation. In housing, it also prohibits discrimination based on custody of a minor child, parenthood and pregnancy. In employment, it also prohibits discrimination based on age, specifically between the ages of 40 and 65 years old.

It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive.

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",
