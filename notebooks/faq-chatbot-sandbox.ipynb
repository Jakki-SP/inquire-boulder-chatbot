       "6   Hello, There are a group of Gambel Oak Trees with Tree ID #'s 38820-38825 that I would like to be pruned up in order to keep them away from the Rec Center wall and to keep them in good, trimmed health. I also would like Tree ID 38825 to be pruned away from the American Flag so it will not come in contact with the tree, from the nearby flag pole. Thank you very much and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to give me a call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.</td>\n",

       "0   I live on the corner of Bear Mountain Drive and Scrub Oak Circle, and would like the City enforce the speed limit on Bear Mountain Drive. Despite a limit of 25 mph, I routinely observe vehicles traveling well above that speed in both directions (especially in the mornings and early evening). There are a ton of kids in this neighborhood, as well as a blind curve in the road between several crosswalks. It baffles me to see so much enforcement on Lehigh (with the regular presence of a photo van) and only the very occasional patrol car on Bear Mountain Drive. It would be great if the photo van or other officers could regularly make an appearance on Bear Mountain.   \n",

       "7   There are constantly dogs off leash in the children playgrounds of columbine school. Even though the playgrounds are fenced and have a sign stating dogs should not go in. You can see some dog owners do not even pick their dog shit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8   I parked in the garage on 11th and Walnut on Sunday 12/23 starting at 5 PM and left at 12:35 AM that Monday 12/24. I was charged $1.25 but it should have still been free since charged parking doesnâ€™t start till 7 AM on Mondays , I park here all the time and I am confused as to why it says I owed $1.25.
