      "The City of Boulder is committed to making housing in our community available to a variety of people, including those who could not otherwise purchase a home in Boulder's housing market. The Division of Housing offers opportunities for homeownership to those with low and moderate incomes - from down payment assistance on market rate homes to homes that must be sold at affordable prices. How long does it take to become income-certified?Generally up to two weeks. Who needs to be on the application?Everyone who lives in the household or is part of the household, in addition to all people who will be listed on the property title. Household members should include all individuals: legal spouse, domestic partner, or common-law spouse; children(under 18 who reside with the applicant at least 50 percent of the time; and/or a significant other whom the applicant chooses to include as a member of his/her household, who will be occupying the house. The applicant's spouse must be included unless they are legally divorced or separated. Persons not counted include foster children, unborn children, and children under 18 who reside with the applicant less then 50 percent of the time. How is annual income calculated?Annual income is defined as the anticipated total income for the next 12-month period received from all sources by each member (over the age of 18) of the household. It is assumed that today's circumstances will continue for the next 12 months. The applicant is required to verify this by either submitting a letter from his/her employer stating his/her annual wage or by completing an employer verification form. To obtain this form, call the Housing Division at 303-441-3157 ext. 2. How is income verified for self-employed people?Self-employed individuals should submit copies of their last three years of federal income-tax forms and must also submit an up-to-date profit/loss statement. How are assets calculated?Assets are calculated based on annual income earned (interest), not the value of the asset itself. Can I combine any programs?Neither First Home (20 percent down payment) nor the House to Home (15 percent down payment) Assistance Programs can be combined with a HomeWorks (permanently affordable) Home, since these homes have already been subsidized by the City of Boulder or the developer. The 3 percent solution may be used with HomeWorks. Can I have a cosigner?Yes, a non-occupying cosigner will not be included in the household. However, if the cosigner's name appears on the title, her/his income must be included in the income certification application. Do I have to be a first-time home buyer?To qualify for the down payment assistance programs, you must be a first-time home buyer, which means you have not owned a home in the last three years unless you have been divorced (in the last three years) or are a displaced homemaker. You do not have to be a first-time home buyer to purchase an Affordable Home. Do I have to purchase in the city limits of Boulder?Yes. Find out if the property is located in the Boulder City Limits. How are improvements calculated for Affordable Homes?The low-income covenant lists all of the pre-approved capital improvements. The home owner should contact the city before the improvement has begun in order to ensure how the improvement will be calculated into the resale price. Homeowners are allowed to add a maximum of $25,000 to the resale calculation for pre-approved capital improvements. For more information, please visit the Affordable Homeownership Program website.    \n"
